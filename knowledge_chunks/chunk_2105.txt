Early discussions of representation in AI tended to focus on problem representation ratherthan knowledgerepresentation. (See,forexample,Amarel s(1968)discussionofthe
Missionaries and Cannibals problem.) Inthe1970s, AIemphasized thedevelopment of ex-
pert systems (also called knowledge-based systems ) that could, if given the appropriate
domain knowledge, matchorexceed theperformance ofhumanexperts onnarrowlydefined
tasks. For example, the first expert system, DENDRAL (Feigenb
