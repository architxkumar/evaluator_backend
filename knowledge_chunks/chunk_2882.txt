most of the computational effort on the tricky areas within the configuration space, it still

sense that it should be easy to compute a traversal of any free cell. This technique requires

Examining the solution path shown in Figure 25.16(a), we can see an additional diffi-

at any finite speed could not execute such a path. This problem is solved by storing certain
continuous values foreach grid cell. Consider an algorithm which stores, foreach grid cell,
