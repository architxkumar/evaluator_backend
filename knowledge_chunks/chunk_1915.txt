Becausebacktracking enumeratesthedomainsofthevariables,itworksonlyforfinite-
domain CS Ps. In Prolog terms, there must be a finite number of solutions for any goal
withunbound variables. (Forexample, thegoal diff(Q,SA),whichsaysthat Queensland
and South Australia must be different colors, has six solutions if three colors are allowed.)
Infinite-domain CS Ps forexample,withintegerorreal-valuedvariables require quitedif-

Consider the following example. We define triangle(X,Y,Z)as a predicate that
holdsifthethreearguments arenumbersthatsatisfythetriangleinequality:
triangle(X,Y,Z) :-
X 0, Y 0, Z 0, X Y Z, Y Z X, X Z Y.
If we ask Prolog the query triangle(3,4,5), it succeeds. On the other hand, if we
ask triangle(3,4,Z),no solution will be found, because the subgoal Z 0 cannot be
handled by Prolog;wecan tcompareanunbound valueto0.

CONSTRAINTLOGIC Constraint logic programming (CLP) allows variables to be constrained rather than

bound. ACL Psolution isthemostspecific setofconstraints onthe query variables that can

query is the constraint 7 Z 1. Standard logic programs are just a special case of

CLP systems incorporate various constraint-solving algorithms for the constraints al-
lowed in the language. For example, a system that allows linear inequalities on real-valued
variables might include a linear programming algorithm for solving those constraints. CLP
systems also adopt a much more flexible approach to solving standard logic programming
queries. Forexample, instead ofdepth-first, left-to-right backtracking, theymightuseanyof
the more efficient algorithms discussed in Chapter 6, including
