For example, a decision tree may be used in which region attributes and relation values determine the branch taken at each node when descending the tree The leaves of the decision tree are labeled with the object identities as in Figure 14.27.

Objects, with their attributes and relations are then used to construct an associative net scene, a frame network, or other structure. 14.6 VISION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES In this section we present two vision systems which are somewhat representative of complete system architectures. The firsi system is a model-based system, one of the earliest successful vision systems. The second is a color region analyzer recently developed at the University of Kyoto. Japan. 318 Visuai im3ge. Understanding Chap. 14 The ACRONYM System The ACRONYM system is a model-based, domain independent system developed by Rodney Brooks (1981) while at Stanford University during the late. 1970s. The system takes user descriptions of sets of objects as models or patterns which are then used to assist in the identification of structures appearing in monocular images. Figure 14.28 illustrates the main components of the system. The user prepares des
