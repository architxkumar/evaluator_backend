of the problem the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence
of actions. The state space forms a directed network or graph in which the nodes

are states and the links between nodes are actions. (The map of Romania shown in
Figure 3.2 can be interpreted as a state-space graph if we view each road as standing
fortwodriving actions, one ineach direction.) A pathin the state space is asequence
