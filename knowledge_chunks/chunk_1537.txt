search examines all the nodes at
the goal s depth to see if one has a lower cost; thus uniform-cost search does strictly more
workbyexpanding nodesatdepthdunnecessarily.

SEARCH
The progress of the search is illustrated in Figure 3.16. The search proceeds immediately
to the deepest level of the search tree, where the nodes have no successors. As those nodes
are expanded, they are dropped from the frontier, so then the search backs up to the next
deepestnodethatstillhasunexplored successors.
The depth-first search algorithm is an instance of the graph-search algorithm in Fig-
ure3.7;whereasbreadth-first-searchusesa FIF Oqueue,depth-firstsearchusesa LIF Oqueue.
A LIFO queue means that the most recently generated node is chosen for expansion. This

As an alternative to the GRAPH-SEARCH-style implementation, it is common to im-
plement depth-first search witharecursive function that callsitself oneach ofitschildren in
turn. (Arecursivedepth-first algorithm incorporating adepthlimitisshownin Figure3.17.)
