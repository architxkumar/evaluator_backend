Grandparent(x,y) z Mother(x,z) Mother(z,y) z Mother(x,z) Father(z,y) z Father(x,z) Mother(z,y) z Father(x,z) Father(z,y) .
Noticethatanattribute-based learningalgorithm,suchas DECISION-TREE-LEARNING,will
getnowhere insolving thisproblem. Inordertoexpress Grandparent asanattribute (i.e., a
unarypredicate), wewouldneedtomake pairsofpeopleintoobjects:
Grandparent((cid:16)Mum,Charles(cid:17))...
Thenwegetstuckintryingtorepresenttheexampledescriptions. Theonlypossibleattributes
arehorriblethingssuchas
First Element Is Mother Of Elizabeth((cid:16)Mum,Charles(cid:17)).
The definition of Grandparent in terms of these attributes simply becomes a large disjunc-
tionofspecificcasesthatdoesnotgeneralizetonewexamplesatall. Attribute-basedlearning
algorithmsareincapable oflearningrelational predicates. Thus,oneoftheprincipal advan-
tages of ILP algorithms is their applicability to a much wider range of problems, including
relational problems.
Thereader will certainly have noticed that a little bit ofbackground knowledge would
help in the representation of the Grandparent definition. For example, if Background in-
cludedthesentence
