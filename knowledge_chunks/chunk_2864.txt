Mobile robots have a range of mechanisms for locomotion, including wheels, tracks,
and legs. Differential drive robots possess two independently actuated wheels (or tracks),

To avoid chaos, the wheels are tightly coordinated. When moving straight, for example, all

Some mobile robots possess arms. Figure 25.5(a) displays a two-armed robot. This
