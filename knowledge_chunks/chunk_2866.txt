25.3 ROBOTIC PERCEPTION
Perceptionistheprocessbywhichrobotsmapsensormeasurementsintointernalrepresenta-
tions of the environment. Perception is difficult because sensors are noisy, and the environ-
ment is partially observable, unpredictable, and often dynamic. In other words, robots have
all the problems of state estimation (or filtering) that we discussed in Section 15.2. As a
rule of thumb, good internal representations for robots have three properties: they contain
enoughinformationfortherobottomakegooddecisions, theyarestructuredsothattheycan
be updated efficiently, and they are natural in the sense that internal variables correspond to
naturalstatevariablesinthephysical world.

ity distribution over the environment state variables. Several dynamic Bayes net models for
this process were shown in Chapter 15. For robotics problems, we include the robot s own
past actions as observed variables in the model. Figure 25.7 shows the notation used in this
