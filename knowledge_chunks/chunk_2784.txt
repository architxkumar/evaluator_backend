The systems with the highest accuracy work by training a different model for each
speaker, thereby capturing differences indialect aswellasmale female andothervariations.
This training can require several hours of interaction with the speaker, so the systems with
themostwidespread adoption donotcreatespeaker-specific models.

23.6 SUMMARY
Natural language understanding is one of the most important subfields of AI. Unlike most
otherareasof AI,naturallanguageunderstandingrequires anempiricalinvestigationofactual
humanbehavior which turnsouttobecomplexandinteresting. Formal language theory and phrase structure grammars (and in particular, context-
free grammar) are useful tools fordealing withsome aspects of natural language. The
probabilistic context-free grammar(PCFG)formalismiswidelyused.
