cts that have property P also have property Q, we conclude that a has property Q. P( a) V.i P(x) -, Q(x) Q(a) Note that in concluding Q(a), a substitution of a for x was necessary. This was possible, of course, since the implication P(x) . Q(x) is assumed true for all X. and in particular for .r = a. .Substitutions are an essential part of the inference process. When properly applied, they permit simplifications or the reduction of expressions through the cancellation of complementary literals. We say that two literals are complementary if they are identical but of opposite sign: that is. P and are complementary. A substitution is defined as a set of pairs:, and v where v, are distinct variables and t, are terms not containing the v,. The :, replace or are substituted for the corresponding r, in any expression for which the substitution is applied. A set of substitutions {t1/v1 t,/v,.....t,,1v} where a I applied to an expression will be denoted by Greek letters ct, P. and 8. For example, if 3= {a/x. g(b)/v}, then applying 13 to the clause C = P(x,v) V Q(xfiv)) we obtain C' = CO = P(a,g(h)) V Q(af(g(b))). Unification Any substitution that makes two or more expressions equal is called a unifier for the expressions. Applying a substitution to an expression produces an instance E' of E where E' = 13. Given two expressions that are unifiable, such as expressions C1 and C with a i,iifer 13 with C1f3 = C2, we say that 13 is a most general unier (mgu) if any other unifer cs is an instance of 13. For example two unifiers for the literals P(u,b,v) and P(a,x,y) are ot = a/u,b/x,u/v) and 13 = {alu,blx,clv,c/y}. The former is an mgu whereas the latter is not since it is an instance of the foriiier. Unification can sometimes be applied to literals within the same single clause. When an mgu exists such that two or more literals within a clause are unified, the clause remaining after deletion of all but one of the unified literals is called a 66 Formalized Symbolic Logics Chap. 4 J
