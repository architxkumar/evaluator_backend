Similarly, in first-order logic wecan quantify overtime, so weneed just one successor-state
axiom for each predicate, rather than a different copy for each time step. For example, the
axiomforthearrow(Equation(7.2)onpage267)becomes t Have Arrow(t 1) (Have Arrow(t) Action(Shoot,t)).
From these two example sentences, we can see that the first-order logic formulation is no
less concise than the original English-language description given in Chapter 7. The reader
