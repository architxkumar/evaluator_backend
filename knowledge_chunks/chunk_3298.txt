Town-B is connected to Town-C by Road-24.5 Convert axioms Al-A5 from Problem 4.4 to clausal form and write axioms A6-A13, below, directly into clausal form. A6. Town-A is connected to Town-C by Road-3. A7. Town-D is connected to Town-E by Road-4. A8. Town-D is connected to Town-B by Road-S. A9-A1I. Bikes are allowed on Road-3, Road-4, and Road-S. Al2. Bikes are always allowed on either Road-2 or Road-I (each day it may be different but one road is always possible). A13.
