Chapters 3 and 4 explored the idea that problems can be solved by searching in a space of
states. Thesestatescanbeevaluated bydomain-specific heuristics andtestedtoseewhether
they are goal states. From the point of view of the search algorithm, however, each state is
atomic,orindivisible a blackboxwithnointernalstructure.
This chapter describes away to solve a wide variety of problems more efficiently. We
use a factored representation for each state: a set of variables, each of which has a value.
A problem is solved when each variable has a value that satisfies all the constraints on the

variable. Aproblem described
