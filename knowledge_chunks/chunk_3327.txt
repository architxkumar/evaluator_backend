),(.2,.5).(0, 1))) = max,{(1,.5,0,01,(.5,.6,.2,0],(O..5,.2,01.(0,0..2,0]} = {( 11,1.61,1 .51,E.21} Therefore the solution is = {(l /1),(2 /.6),(3 /.5),(4/.2)}. Stated in terms of a fuzzy modus ponens, we might interpret this as the inference Premise: x is little Implication: x and y are approximately equal Conclusion: y is more or less little The above notions can be generalized to any number of universes by taking the Cartesian product and defining relations on various subsets. Natural Language Computations Earlier, we mentioned linguistic variables without really defining them. Linguistic variables provide a link between a natural or artifical language and representations which accommodate quantification such as fuzzy propositions. In this section. we Sec. 5.6 Fuzzy Logic and Natural Language Computations 103 formally define a linguistic variable and show how they are related to fuzzy logic. Informally, a linguistic variable is a variable that assumes a value consisting of words or sentences rather than numbers. For example, the variable AGE might assume values of very young, young, not young, or not old. These values, which are themselves linguistic variables. may in turn, each be given meaning through a base universe of elapsed time (years). This is accomplished through appropriately defined characteristic functions. As an example, let the linguistic variable AGE have possible values {very young, young, not young, middle-aged, not old, old, very old}. To each of these variables, we associate a fuzzy set consisting of ordered tuples {(x Iu A(x))} where x E U = (0.110] the universe (years). The variable AGE, its values, and their corresponding fuzzy sets are, illustrated in Figure 5.8. A formal, more elegant definition of a linguistic variable is one which is based on language theory concepts. For this, we define a linguistic variable as the. quintuple (x,T(x),U,G,M) where x is the name of the variable (AGE in the above example), T(x) is the terminal set of x (ver
