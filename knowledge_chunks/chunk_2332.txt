hen estimating the utility of
successor states of the root node in backgammon). In that case, we are really working with
estimates E ! U(a e) of the true expected utility. We will assume, kindly perhaps, that the

zero. In that case, it still seems reasonable to choose the action with the highest estimated
utilityandtoexpecttoreceivethatutility, onaverage, whentheactionisexecuted.
Unfortunately, the real outcome will usually be significantly worse than we estimated,
even though the estimate was unbiased! To see why, consider a decision problem in which
there are k choices, each of which has true estimated utility of 0. Suppose that the error in
each utility estimate has zero mean and standard deviation of 1, shown as the bold curve in
Figure 16.3. Now, as we actually start to generate the estimates, some of the errors will be
negative (pessimistic) and some will be positive (optimistic). Because we select the action
with the highest utility estimate, we are obviously favoring the overly optimistic estimates,
and that is the source of the bias. It is a straightforward matter to calculate the distribution
of the maximum of the k estimates (see Exercise 16.11) and hence quantify the extent of
our disappointment. The curve in Figure 16.3 for k 3 has a mean around 0.85, so the
average disappointment will be about 85 of the standard deviation in the utility estimates.

With more choices, extremely optimistic estimates are more likely to arise: for k 30, the

This tendency for the estimated expected utility of the best choice to be too high is
