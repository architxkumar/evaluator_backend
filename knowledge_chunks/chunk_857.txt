AFFECT has six basic constituents. 1. STATE Characterizes the nature of the sentiment and can be positive (POS) or negative (NEG). 2. CHAR Identifies the actor in the narrative who is feeling the emotion. 3. G-SITU Refers to the goal situation that is the context for the emotion. 4. TOWARD (optional) Identifies if the emotion is directed towards someone. 5. SCALE Measures the intensity of the emotion. BORIS supports two values: NORM (more than normal) and NORM (less that normal). 6. E-MODE (optional) If the characters have an expectation about likely future outcomes. Some examples of AFFECTs are, Happy, joyous, glad (AFFECT STATE (POS) CHAR x G-SITU (goal of x achieved)) Grateful, thankful (AFFECT STATE (POS) CHAR x G-SITU (y caused (goal of c achieved) to occur) TOWARD y) Fearful, worried (AFFECT STATE (NEG) CHAR x G-SITU (P-goal is active) E-MODE (UNEXPECTED) ) Guilty, ashamed, (AFFECT Embarrassed STATE (NEG) CHAR x (G-SITU (goal of y thwarted by x)) TOWARD y) Emotions arise not only because of what happens to you, but also due to what happens to other people. In BORIS, interpersonal themes (IPTs) are structures that capture this relationship, expressed in an empathy table expressing rules such as the following: em1: If x and y are friends and y has a goal failure Then x will experience a NEG AFFECT. em2: If y has a failure and x experiences POS AFFECT Then either x and y are enemies, or they are in conflict over this goal. BORIS also employs a structure called ACE (Affect as a Consequence of Empathy) when a character expresses empathy for another character. Some examples of ACEs are, commiserate, theme (IPT-FRIENDS x y) condole MTRANS TO y that goal failure (y) causes: x feel NEG felicitate, theme (IPT-FRIENDS x y) congratulate MTRANS TO y that goal success (y) causes: x feel POS gloat theme (IPT-ENEMIES x y) MTRANS TO y that goal failure (y) causes: x feel POS envy, theme (IPT-ENEMIES x y) jealous, MTRANS TO y spiteful that goal success (y) causes: x feel NEG Go
