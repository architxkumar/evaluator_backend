unrolled into a Bayesian network. This is exactly analogous to the method of proposition-
alization for first-order logical inference. (See page 322.) Resolution theorem-provers and
logic programming systems avoid propositionalizing by instantiating the logical variables

the level of ground propositional sentences and make each lifted step do the work of many
ground steps. Thesame idea applied inprobabilistic inference. Forexample, inthe variable

We argued earlier that database semantics was appropriate for situations in which we know
