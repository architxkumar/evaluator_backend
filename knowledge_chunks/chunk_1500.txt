Careful attention to the properties of the environment and their consequences for ra-
tional agent design is most apparent in the control theory tradition for example, classical
control systems (Dorf and Bishop, 2004; Kirk, 2004) handle fully observable, deterministic
environments; stochastic optimal control (Kumar and Varaiya, 1986; Bertsekas and Shreve,
2007) handles partially observable, stochastic environments; and hybrid control (Henzinger
and Sastry, 1998; Cassandras and Lygeros, 2006) deals with environments containing both
discrete andcontinuous elements. Thedistinction between fully andpartially observable en-
vironments is also central in the dynamic programming literature developed in the field of
operations research (Puterman,1994), whichwediscuss in Chapter17.
Reflex agents were the primary model for psychological behaviorists such as Skinner
(1953),whoattemptedtoreducethepsychologyoforganismsstrictlytoinput outputorstim-
ulus response mappings. The advance from behaviorism to functionalism in psychology,
which wasatleast partly driven bythe application ofthe computer metaphortoagents (Put-
nam, 1960; Lewis, 1966), introduced the internal state of the agent into the picture. Most
work in AI views the idea of pure reflex agents with state as too simple to provide much
leverage, but work by Rosenschein (1985) and Brooks (1986) questioned this assumption
(see Chapter 25). In recent years, a great deal of work has gone into finding efficient algo-
rithmsforkeepingtrackofcomplexenvironments(Hamscheretal.,1992;Simon,2006). The
