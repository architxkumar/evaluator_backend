BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES
The use of networks to represent probabilistic information began early in the 20th century,
with the work of Sewall Wright on the probabilistic analysis of genetic inheritance and an-
imal growth factors (Wright, 1921, 1934). I. J. Good (1961), in collaboration with Alan
Turing, developed probabilistic representations and Bayesian inference methods that could
be regarded as a forerunner of modern Bayesian networks although the paper is not often
citedinthiscontext.10
