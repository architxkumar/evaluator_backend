the so-called total Turing Test includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the

ROBOTICS
These six disciplines compose most of AI, and Turing deserves credit for designing a test
that remains relevant 60 years later. Yet AI researchers have devoted little effort to passing
the Turing Test, believing that it is more important to study the underlying principles of in-
