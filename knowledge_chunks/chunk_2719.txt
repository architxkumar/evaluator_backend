CASCADED
A relational extraction system can be built asa series of cascaded finite-state transducers.
FINITE-STATE
TRANSDUCERS
Thatis,thesystem consists ofaseries ofsmall,efficientfinite-state automata(FS As),where
each automaton receives text as input, transduces the text into adifferent format, and passes
italongtothenextautomaton. FASTUS consistsoffivestages:
1. Tokenization
2. Complex-wordhandling
3. Basic-group handling
4. Complex-phrase handling
5. Structuremerging
FASTUS s first stage is tokenization, which segments the stream of characters into tokens
(words, numbers, and punctuation). For English, tokenization can be fairly simple; just sep-
aratingcharacters atwhitespaceorpunctuation doesafairlygoodjob. Sometokenizers also
dealwithmarkuplanguages suchas HTML,SGML,and XML.
Thesecond stage handles complexwords, including collocations suchas setup and joint venture, as well as proper names such as Bridgestone Sports Co. These are rec-
ognized by a combination of lexical entries and finite-state grammar rules. For example, a

Capitalized Word ( Company Co Inc Ltd )
The third stage handles basic groups, meaning noun groups and verb groups. T
