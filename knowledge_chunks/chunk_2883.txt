There exist many other ways to modify the cost function. For example, it may be
desirable to smooth the control parameters over time. For example, when driving a car, a
smooth pathisbetterthan ajerky one. Ingeneral, suchhigher-order constraints arenoteasy

Figure 25.18 shows an example skeletonization: it is a Voronoi graph of the free

space the set of all points that are equidistant to two or more obstacles. To do path plan-
ning with a Voronoi graph, the robot first changes its present configuration to a point on the
Voronoi graph. It is easy to show that this can always be ac
