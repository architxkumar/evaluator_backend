outcomes of actions are uncertain), but it is not the last word on planning. Chapter 17
describes techniques for stochastic environments (in which outcomes of actions have
probabilities associated with them): Markov decision processes, partially observable
Markovdecisionprocesses,andgametheory. In Chapter21weshowthatreinforcement

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES
Planning with time constraints was first dealt with by DEVISER (Vere, 1983). The repre-
sentation of time in plans was addressed by Allen (1984) and by Dean et al. (1990) in the
FORBIN system. NONLIN (Tate and Whiter, 1984) and SIPE (Wilkins, 1988, 1990) could
reason about the allocation of limited resources to various plan steps. O-PLAN (Bell and
Tate, 1985), an HTN planner, had a uniform, general representation for constraints on time
and resources. In addition to the Hitachi application mentioned in the text, O-PLAN has
been applied tosoftware procurement planning at Price Waterhouse andback-axle assembly
planning at Jaguar Cars.
The two planners SAPA (Do and Kambhampati, 2001) and T4 (Haslum and Geffner,
2001) both used forward state-space search with sophisticated heuristics to handle actions
with durations and resources. An alternative is to use very expressive action languages, but
guide them by human-written domain-specific heuristics, as is done by ASPEN (Fukunaga
etal.,1997), HSTS(Jonssonetal.,2000), and Ix Te T(Ghallaband Laruelle,1994).
432 Chapter 11. Planningand Actinginthe Real World
A number of hybrid planning-and-scheduling systems have been deployed: ISIS (Fox
et al., 1982; Fox, 1990) has been used forjob shop scheduling at Westinghouse, GARI (De-
scotte and Latombe, 1985) planned the machining and construction of mechanical parts,
FORBIN was used for factory control, and NONLIN was used for naval
