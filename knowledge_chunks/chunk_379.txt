e nodes visited by SSS . The shaded nodes are the ones that were marked SOLVED by SSS at some point. When D is removed (Line 21), its sibling D; is added to OPEN as a LIVE node. OPEN ( Dj, LIVE, 11 , A1, SOLVED, 10 , B1, SOLVED, 7 ) When the LIVE node D, is removed, lines 6-15 are executed again to give, OPEN ( A1, SOLVED, 10 , D;1, SOLVED, 9 , B1, SOLVED, 7 , D21, SOLVED, 7 ) At this point, node A1 becomes better and SSS shifts attention to it. It is replaced by its sibling A2 with a value 5, the smaller of 10 and 5. OPEN now looks like, OPEN ( D,1, SOLVED, 9 , B1, SOLVED, 7 , D21, SOLVED, 7 , A2, SOLVED, 5 ) Now Dj7 is replaced by D2 with a value 8, and that being the last sibling, the parent D172 is labelled SOLVED. OPEN ( D112, SOLVED, 8 , B1, SOLVED, 7 , D21, SOLVED, 7 , A2, SOLVED, 5 ) When the MIN nodes D,12 is removed, its parent D; is added as a SOLVED node, and the MIN sibling D21 removed from OPEN (an Alpha cutoff). OPEN ( D;, SOLVED, 8 , B1, SOLVED, 7 , A2, SOLVED, 5 ) Now since Dy, is the last sibling, its parent DD, is labelled as a SOLVED node with the value 8. When this M N node is removed, its parent root is added as a SOLVED node with the value 8, and its siblings, represented by B71 and A2 are removed. Finally, since the root node has been labelled SOLVED, the algorithm terminates. 8.2.4 B Search Another approach to selective search was developed by Hans Berliner, who had the distinction of being a world champion in correspondence chess'2, in addition to being a computer scientist. He developed the Hitech chess machine (Berliner, 1987) that used a specialized sixty four custom VLSI chip architecture. The B algorithm is a result of a quest for an algorithm that searches selectively in a humanlike manner. Berliner defines the necessary conditions for selective search as follows (Berliner, 1979), 1. It must be able to stop when a clearly best alternative exists at the root. This is done by comparison and is independent of the ultimate value of the be
