4.6 SUMMARY
This chapter has examined search algorithms for problems beyond the classical case of
findingtheshortest pathtoagoalinanobservable, deterministic, discreteenvironment. Local search methods such as hill climbing operate on complete-state formulations,
keeping only a small number of nodes in memory. Several stochastic algorithms have
beendeveloped,includingsimulatedannealing,whichreturnsoptimalsolutionswhen
givenanappropriate coolingschedule. Many local search methods apply also to problems in continuous spaces. Linear pro-
gramming and convex optimization problems obey certain restrictions on the shape
of the state space and the nature of the objective function, and admit polynomial-time
