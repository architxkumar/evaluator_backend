Nonparametric densityestimation, alsocalled Parzenwindowdensity estimation, was
investigated initially by Rosenblatt (1956) and Parzen (1962). Since thattime, ahuge litera-
turehasdevelopedinvestigating theproperties ofvarious estimators. Devroye(1987)givesa
thorough introduction. There isalsoarapidly growing literature onnonparametric Bayesian
methods, originating with the seminal work of Ferguson (1973) on the Dirichlet process,

Jordan (2005) provide useful tutorials on the many applications of these ideas to statistical
learning. The text by Rasmussen and Williams (2006) covers the Gaussian process, which
