The full joint probabilities have already been specified, so we are done that is, unless we
care about computation. There are 12 unknown squares; hence the summation contains
212 4096terms. Ingeneral,thesummationgrowsexponentiallywiththenumberofsquares.
Surely, one might ask, aren t the other squares irrelevant? How could 4,4 affect
whether 1,3 has a pit? Indeed, this intuition is correct. Let Frontier be the pit variables
(other than the query variable) that are adjacent to visited squares, in this case just 2,2 and 3,1 . Also,let Other bethepitvariablesfortheotherunknownsquares;inthiscase,thereare

conditionally independent of the other variables, given the known, frontier, and query vari-
ables. Touse the insight, wemanipulate the query formula into aform inwhich the breezes
areconditioned onalltheothervariables, andthenweapply conditional independence:

By independence, as in Equation (13.20), the prior term can be factored, and then the terms
