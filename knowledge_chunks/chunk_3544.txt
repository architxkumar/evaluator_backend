standing first requires recognition of basic speech patterns. These patterns are matched against lexicon patterns for recognition. Basic speech Units such as phonemes are the building blocks for longer units such as syllables and words. EXERCISES 13.1. Choose three common Objects and determine live of their most discriminating visual attributes. 13.2. For the previous problem. determine three additional nonvisual attributes for the objects which are most discriminating 13.3. Find a linear decision function which separates the following - v points into two distinct classes. -1.8 -5.--1 -3.3 -3.0 1.3 -1.1 0.1 3.4 0.0 2.3 -4. I -2.3 13.4. Describe how you would design a pattern recognition program which must validate hand written signatures. Identify some potential problem areas 13.5. Compare the deterministic decision function approach to the probabilistic decision function apporoach in pattern recognition applications. Give examples when each would be the appropriate function to use. 13.6. Define a set of rewrite rules for a grammar for ssntactic .generation (recognition) of objects such as the object of Figure 13.4. 13.7. give two examples of unsupersised learning in humans in which they learn to recognize objects through clustering. Describe how different goals can influence the learning process. 13.8. Apply the ISODATA algorithm to find three different clusters among the following .r-v data points. -2.1 -1.3 -1,2 -1.0 0.2 13 1.2 1.1 1.0 2.9 2.8 2.5 2.0 3.9 3.7 3.6 4.8 4.6 4.3 4.2 5.4 5.3 5.2 6.3 - 6.3 7.7 7.5 7.4 7.2 7.0 -1.6 -2.6 13.9. Consider a cluster algorithm which builds clusters of objects by forming small regions in normalized attribute space (spheres in n-dimensional space) about each object, and includes them in a cluster if and only if the sphere overlaps with at least one other neighboring object sphere. Show how such a scheme could be used to partition the attribute space into subspace with nonlinear boundaries. 13.10. Define an alphabet of shape pri
