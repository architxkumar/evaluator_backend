The problem is, given a set of sentences S = {s.......} (the premises), prove the truth of s (the conclusion); that is, show that St-s. The use of truth tables to do this is a form of semantic proof. Other syntactic methods of inference or deduction are also possible. Such methods do not depend on truth assignments but on syntactic relationships only; that is. It is possible to derive new sentences which are logical consequences of s ...... .s,, using only syntactic operations. We present a few such rules now which will be referred to often throughout the text. Modus ponens. From P and P --' Q infer Q. This is sometimes written as P P . Q Q for example given: (joe.is a father) and: t Joe is a father) - (Joe has a child) conclude: (Joe has a child) Chain rule. From p - Q. and Q -. R, inter P - R. Or P . Q Q .R P R For example. given: (programmer likes LISP) -. (programmer hates COBOL) and: (programmer hates COBOL) - Programmer likes recursion) conclude: (programmer likes LISP) - (programmer likes recursion) Substitution. Ifs is a valid sentence, s' derived from .s by consistent substitution of propositions in s, is also valid. For example the sentence P V P is valid: therefore Q V Q is also valid by the substitution rule. Simplification. From P & Q infer P. Conjunction. From P and from Q. inter P & Q. Trarisjosition. From P Q. infer Q - P. We leave it to the reader to justify the last three rules given above. We conclude this section with the following definitions. Sec. 4.3 Syntax and Semantics for FOPL Formal system A formal system is a set of axioms S and a set of inference L from which new statements can be logically derived. We will somet
