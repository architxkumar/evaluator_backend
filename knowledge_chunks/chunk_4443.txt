tain? We can add two qualitative values with the following chart: empty + empty = empty empty + between = between empty + full = full between + between = { between, full} between + full = full + overflow full + full = full + overflow Notice that qualitative addition differs from its quantitative counterpart, in part because the result of qualitative addition may be ambiguous. For example, if both glasses are between empty and full, it is impossible to know whether combining them will result in a full glass or not. Equations Expressions and variables can be linked to one another via equations. The simplest equation states that variable x increases as variable y increases. This gives us an abstract representation of the actual function relating x and y (it may be linear, quadratic, or logarithmic, for example). States Traditional physics models a process as a set of variables whose values evolve over time. A state is a single snapshot in which each variable possesses one value. Within qualitative physics, there are several different ways of formulating state information. One idea [de Kleer, 1979] is to combine qualitative state variables with symbolic descriptions. For example, the state of Fig. 19.1(a) might be represented as (BALL-1, IN-AIR, DOWN). In order to predict the behavior of devices, de Kleer and Brown [1984] represent a state as a network of connected components. Forbus [1984] presents a state organization centered on processes and their influences. 19.1.2 Reasoning with Qualitative Information No matter how states are represented, we need some way to reason about the information contained in them. A common reasoning method in qualitative physics is called qualitative simulation [Kuipers, 1986]. The idea ' In some variations [Raiman, 19861, it is possible to state that one value is much larger than another, or that two values are unequal but very close to one another.
