d. Onecan easily imagine actions withhigh negative cost, even indomains such asroute
finding. For example, some stretches of road might have such beautiful scenery as to
far outweigh the normal costs in terms of time and fuel. Explain, in precise terms,
withinthecontext ofstate-space search, whyhumans donotdrivearound scenic loops
indefinitely, and explain how to define the state space and actions for route finding so
thatartificialagentscanalsoavoid looping.
