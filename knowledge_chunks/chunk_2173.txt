shows that burglary and earthquakes directly affect the probability of the alarm s going off,
but whether John and Mary call depends only on the alarm. The network thus represents

The conditional distributions in Figure 14.2 are shown as a conditional probability
CONDITIONAL table, or CPT. (This form of table can be used for discrete variables; other representations,

including those suitable for continuous variables, are described in Section 14.2.) Each row
in a CPT contains the conditional probability of each node value for a conditioning case.
CONDITIONINGCASE
A conditioning case is just a possible combination of values for the parent nodes a minia-
ture possible world, if you like. Each row must sum to 1, because the entries represent an
