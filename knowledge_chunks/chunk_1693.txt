Chesswasoneofthefirsttasksundertakenin AI,withearlyefforts bymanyofthepio-
neersofcomputing,including Konrad Zusein1945,Norbert Wienerinhisbook Cybernetics
(1948), and Alan Turing in 1950 (see Turing et al., 1953). But it was Claude Shannon s
article Programming a Computer for Playing Chess (1950) that had the most complete set
of ideas, describing a representation for board positions, an evaluation function, quiescence
search, andsomeideasforselective (nonexhaustive) game-treesearch. Slater(1950)andthe
commentators onhisarticlealsoexplored thepossibilities forcomputerchessplay.
D. G. Prinz (1952) completed a program that solved chess endgame problems but did
not play a full game. Stan Ulam and a group at the Los Alamos National Lab produced a
program that played chess on a 6 6 board with no bishops (Kister et al., 1957). It could
search 4pliesdeepinabout12minutes. Alex Bernstein wrote thefirstdocumented program
toplayafullgameofstandard chess(Bernsteinand Roberts, 1958).5

The Fredkin Prize, established in 1980, offered awards for progressive milestones in
chess play. The 5,000 prize forthe firstprogram
