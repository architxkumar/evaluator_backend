years of building these systems, experts were asked for the probability of a cause given an

a scale from best to worst outcome and give each a numeric value, for example 0 for death
and 1 for complete recovery. We would then place the other outcomes on this scale. This

Verify and refine the model. To evaluate the system we need a set of correct (input,
output) pairs; a so-called gold standard to compare against. For medical expert systems

this usually means assembling the best available doctors, presenting them with a few cases,
