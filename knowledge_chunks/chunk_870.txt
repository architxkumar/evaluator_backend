 process that, LivingCreature(fido25), and Vx (Dog(x) D LivingCreature(x)) The equivalent (given) statements in DL are, fido25 -Dog Dog E Animal Animal LivingCreature And the sentences we want to show to be true are, fido25 LivingCreature Dog LivingCreature The approach taken in DL is quite different. First, observe that if we can show that a dog is a living creature, we can also show that Fido is a living creature. So the key thing is to be able to show that subsumption holds between the two concepts. In DL, we show subsumption by comparing the descriptions of the two concepts in question. If an animal is defined as a living creature with some additional properties, Animal AND LivingCreature XX ...X; and a dog is defined as an animal with some additional properties, Dog AND Animal Y; Y2 ... Ypl then we can effectively write, Dog AND LivingCreature X; Xp ... Xx Y1 Yo -.- Ypl This says the set of dogs (or Dog concept) is the intersection of the set of living creatures (the LivingCreature concept) and some other sets. The set of dogs then is necessarily a subset of the set of living creatures which holds iff (Dog LivingCreature). This is a process of structure matching. We only compare the two descriptions after reducing them to a canonical form to decide whether one concept subsumes another or not. The comparison process will be linear in the length of the descriptions. 14.7.3 Normalization The process of reducing DL expressions into a canonical form is called normalization. In the canonical form, any names assigned to compound concepts are replaced by their equivalent descriptions, the description contains only atomic concept names, and any redundant expressions are removed. The following are the replacement steps in the normalization procedure. Replace, any concept n by its definition d, if there is a statement of the form n d, an expression of the form AND ... X Y AND PQ ... R T with AND ...XYPQ... R an expression of the form AND ... ALL r dy ... ALL r do ... with
