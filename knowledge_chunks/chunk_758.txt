t,, f, t2)) 2 HoldsAt(f, tz) To move from line 14 to line 15 we would need to apply the following instance of the above axiom, HoldsAtinflated(bicycle39), t))A(t tg)A PersistsBetween(t,, inflated(bicycle39), 73) Clipped(t,, inflated(bicycle39), f3) HoldsAt(nflated(bicycle39), t3) A transitivity rule can be added to take care of the formula (t, ts). We need to show that PersistsBetween(t;, inflated(bicycle39), 3) and Clipped(t,, inflated(bicycle39), tz) hold before we can show that the bike is inflated at time f3. The former says that the ReleasedAt(inflated(bicycle39), t) did not happen for any time t between ft, and ft, (the fluent was not released from the commonsense law of inertia), while the latter says that no event happened during that time which would have made the fluent false. Likewise for the fluent loc(Nikhil53, cricketPractice11) to be true at time tg, or the formula HoldsAt(loc(Nikhil53, cricketPractice11), to) to be entailed, one has to make an assumption that nothing else happens that interferes with the chain of events that make the fluent true, and nothing happens after it has been made true that makes it false. Such assumptions are characteristic of non-monotonic reasoning where one deals, with statements that can change their truth value. We do not need to make such circumscribing assumptions in classical (mathematical) Rag REEaBRF once a conclusion is deduced the addition of other statements does not change its truth value. Hence mathematical reasoning can happen in an open world, but deductive reasoning about change can effectively happen only under assumptions that it is a closed world. That is, we assume that we know everything that is relevant, and if we don t know something to be true, it must be either false (negation by failure) or irrelevant to the conclusion we are interested in.
