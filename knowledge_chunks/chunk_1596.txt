ocal beam search, useful information is passed among the parallel search
threads. In effect, the states that generate the best successors say to the others, Come over
here, the grass is greener! The algorithm quickly abandons unfruitful searches and moves

In its simplest form, local beam search can suffer from a lack of diversity among the
k states they canquickly becomeconcentrated inasmallregionofthestate space, making
thesearch little morethananexpensive version ofhillclimbing. Avariant called stochastic
STOCHASTICBEAM beam search, analogous to stochastic hill climbing, helps alleviate this problem. Instead

of choosing the best k from the the pool of candidate successors, stochastic beam search
chooses k successors at random, with the probability of choosing a given successor being
an increasing function of its value. Stochastic beam search bears some resemblance to the
process of natural selection, whereby the successors (offspring) of a state (organism)
populate thenextgeneration according toits value (fitness).
