tProperty, is a role that takes another concept or class as a filler. The owl:ObjectProperty specfies a binary relation between two objects in the domain. The second, owl:DatatypeProperty, relates an owl:Class element to values from a data type. Each of the three, the owl:Class, owl:ObjectProperty, and owl:DatatypeProperty is an rdfs:Resource. Every OWL document begins with a header specifying a number of namespaces. rdf:RDF xmlns:owl http: waw.w3.org 2002 07 owl xmlnsirdf http: waw.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns xmlns:rdfs http: www.w3.org 2000 01 rdi-schema xmlns:xsd http: waw.w3.org 2001 XLMSchema OWL definitions usually give names to classes and properties, though anonymous definitions are possible. An OWL class may be defined, for example, as follows. owl:Class rdf:ID khayal rdfs:subClassOf ref:resource hindustani owl:Class or owl:Class rdf:ID vocalist rdfs:subClassOf ref:resource musician owl:Class We can relate a named class to other classes by asserting that they are equivalent or that they are disjoint, owl:Class rdf:about hindustani owl:equivalentClass rdf:resource northIndianClassical owl:disjointWith rdf:resource carnatic owl:disjointWith rdf:resource " jazz" owl:disjointWith rdf:resource indiPop owl:disjointWith rdf:resource westernClassical owl:Class The first line in the above uses hindustani to refer to the class hindustani, defined elsewhere. We can define a class to be the complement, union or intersection of other, possibly anonymous classes. owl:Class rdf: ID "indianMusic owl:unionOf rdf:parseType "Collection owl:Class rdf:about hindustani owl:Class rdf:about carnatic cowl:class rdf:about " folkMusic owl:Class rdf:about " filmMusic owl:unionof owl:Class and, owl:Class rdf:ID bhimsenKhayals owl:intersectionOf rdf:parseType "Collection owl:Class rdf:about " khayal owl:Restriction owl:onProperty rdf:resource singer owl:hasValue rdf:resource bhimsenJoshi owl:Restriction owl:intersectionof owl:Class The last example above states that the set of khaya
