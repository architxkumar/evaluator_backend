g clauses, we know that no such clause can be generated and thus we conclude that hate(Marcus, Caesar) will not produce a contradiction with the known statements. This is an example of the kind of situation in which the resolution procedure can detect that no contradiction exists. Sometimes this situation is detected not at the beginning of a proof, but part way through, as shown in the example in Figure 5.10(a), based on the axioms given in Fig. 5.9, But suppose our knowledge base contained the two additional statements loyalto (Marcus, Caesar) 5 Marcus/x2 3. Roman (Marcus) \/ loyalto (Marcus, Caesar) NN Marcus/x, Pompeian (Marcus) \/ hate (Marcus, Caesar) 2 a hate (Marcus, Caesar) (a) hate (Marcus, Caesar) 10 NL Marcusin, Caesar/y3 persecute (Caesar, Marcus) 9 o N mrcusis, Caesar/y2 hate (Marcus, Caesar) (b) Fig. 5.10 An Unsuccessful Attempt at Resolution 9. persecute(x, y) hate(y, x) 10. hate(x, y) persecute(y, x) Converting to clause form, we get 9. apersecute(Xs, yz) \/ hate(yy, x5) 10. shate(%,, 3) VV persecute(y3, X6) These statements enable the proof of Fig. 5.10(a) to continue as shown in Fig. 5.10(b). Now to detect that there is no contradiction we must discover that the only resolvents that can be generated have been generated before. In other words, although we can generate resolvents, we can generate no new ones. 120 Artificial Intelligence asammeniciaena icp acmatatat N ~SMO, Given: 1. nfatherx, y) \V ~>woman(x) (ie. father(x, y) 3 >woman(x) 2. 7mothernx, yi \/ woman(x) . {i.e., Motherx, y) 3 woman(x}) 3. mother{ Chris,Mary) 4, father Chris, Bill) 4 2 ae ~father (x,y) Mother, (x,y) 3 Chris}x, Maryly father (Chris, Mary) Fig. 5.11 The Need to Standardize Variables Axioms in clause form: man( Marcus) Pompeian( Marcus) horn(Marcus, 40) aman(x,) \/ mortaix,) Pompeian(x,) \/ died{x2,79) erupted voicano,79) -morta(x,) \V ~bom(xg, tf) \V 7h t, 150) \/ deaatxg, tp) now = 2008 nalive(x,, 3) \/ 7deaa{x,, ts) deackx, t,) \/ alivelx, &) 10. died xg ts) \V Gti, te)
