Robotics brings together many of the concepts we have seen earlier in the book, in-
cluding probabilistic state estimation, perception, planning, unsupervised learning, and re-
inforcement learning. For some of these concepts robotics serves as a challenging example
application. Forotherconceptsthischapterbreaksnewgroundinintroducing thecontinuous

25.2.1 Sensors
Sensors are the perceptual interface between robot and environment. Passive sensors, such

other sources in the environment. Active sensors, such as sonar, send energy into the envi-

consumption and with a danger of interference when multiple active sensors are used at the
sametime. Whetheractive orpassive, sensors canbe divided into three types, depending on

Range finders are sensors that measure the distance to nearby objects. In the early
