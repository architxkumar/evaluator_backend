search on graphs. The two-point shortest-path algorithm of Dijkstra (1959) is the origin
of uniform-cost search. These works also introduced the idea of explored and frontier sets
(closedandopenlists).
A version of iterative deepening designed to make efficient use of the chess clock was
first used by Slate and Atkin (1977) in the CHESS 4.5 game-playing program. Martelli s algorithm B(1977)includesaniterativedeepeningaspectandalsodominates A sworst-case
performance with admissible but inconsistent heuristics. The iterative deepening technique
came to the fore in work by Korf (1985a). Bidirectional search, which was introduced by
Pohl(1971), canalsobeeffectiveinsomecases.
Theuseofheuristicinformationinproblemsolvingappears inanearlypaperby Simon
and Newell (1958), but the phrase heuristic search and the use of heuristic functions that
estimate the distance to the goal came somewhat later (Newell and Ernst, 1965; Lin, 1965).
Doran and Michie (1966) conducted extensive experimental studies of heuristic search. Al-
thoughtheyanalyzed pathlengthand penetrance (theratioofpathlengthtothetotalnum-
ber of nodes examined so far), they appear to have ignored the information provided by the path cost g(n). The A algorithm, incorporating the current path cost into heuristic search,
wasdevelopedby Hart,Nilsson,and Raphael(1968),withsomelatercorrections(Hartetal., 1972). Dechterand Pearl(1985)demonstrated theoptimalefficiencyof A. Theoriginal A paperintroduced theconsistency condition onheuristic functions. The
