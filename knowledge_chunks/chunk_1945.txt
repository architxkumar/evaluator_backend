9.22 Construct an example of two clauses that can be resolved together in two different
waysgivingtwodifferentoutcomes.
9.23 From Horses are animals, it follows that The head of a horse is the head of an
animal. Demonstrate thatthisinference isvalidbycarrying outthefollowingsteps:
a. Translatethepremiseandtheconclusionintothelanguageoffirst-orderlogic. Usethree
predicates: Head Of(h,x)(meaning histheheadofx ),Horse(x),and Animal(x).
b. Negate the conclusion, and convert the premise and the negated conclusion into con-
junctivenormalform.
c. Useresolution toshowthattheconclusion followsfromthe premise.
9.24 Herearetwosentences inthelanguage offirst-orderlogic:
(A) x y (x y)
(B) y x (x y)
a. Assumethatthevariablesrangeoverallthenaturalnumbers0,1,2,..., andthatthe predicate means is greater than or equal to. Under this interpretation, translate
(A)and(B)into English.
b. Is(A)trueunderthisinterpretation?
c. Is(B)trueunderthisinterpretation?
d. Does(A)logically entail(B)?
e. Does(B)logically entail(A)?
f. Using resolution, tryto prove that (A)follows from (B). Do this even ifyou think that
(B)does not logically entail (A);continue until the proof breaks downand you cannot
proceed(ifitdoesbreakdown). Showtheunifyingsubstitutionforeachresolutionstep.

9.25 Resolution can produce nonconstructive proofs for queries with variables, so we had
tointroduce special mechanismstoextract definiteanswers. Explainwhythisissuedoesnot
arisewithknowledgebasescontaining onlydefiniteclauses.
9.26 We said in this chapter that resolution cannot be used to generate all logical conse-
quences ofasetofsentences. Cananyalgorithm dothis?
