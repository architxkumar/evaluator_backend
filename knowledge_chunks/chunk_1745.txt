variable. Backtracking occurs when no legal assignment can be found for a variable.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES
The earliest work related to constraint satisfaction dealt largely with numerical constraints.

mathematician Diophantus (c. 200 284), whoactually considered thedomainofpositive ra-

Finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems also have a long history. For example,
graph coloring (ofwhich mapcoloring isaspecial case) is anold problem in mathematics.
