example, the elbow of a human arm possesses two degree of freedom. It can flex the upper
arm towards oraway, and can rotate right orleft. Thewrist has three degrees offreedom. It
can move up and down, side to side, and can also rotate. Robot joints also have one, two,
or three degrees of freedom each. Six degrees of freedom are required to place an object,
such as a hand, at a particular point in a particular orientation. The arm in Figure 25.4(a)
