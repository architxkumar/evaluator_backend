s based on formal theories the more pragmatic ad hoc approaches to uncertain reasoning were examined. In particular, the procedures used in MYCIN which combine measures of belief and disbelief into certainty factors were described. Because of its success, a number of expert systems designs have been patterned after this method. Finally, heuristic, nonnumeric approaches to the uncertainty problem were considered. Here, endorsements for a given alternative would outweigh negative factors if general rules, data, and other domain knowledge provided stronger support. The SOLOMON and AM systems use a form of heuristic control to reason with uncertain knowledge. EXERCISES 6.1 Find the probability of the event A when it is known that some event B occurred. From experiments it has been determined that P8IA) = 0.84. P(A) = 0.2. and P(B) 0.34. 6.2 Prove that iffl and fi are independent. PAIB) = Pt A). (Note that and are independent if and only if P(A & B) P(A)P(B)). 6.3 From basic set theory prove that P( A) I - PIA). and that Pt 8'v4) I P(B,4). 6.4 Is it possible to compute P>A B) when you are only given PIA). P(8A). and PIB),I Explain your answer. 6.5 Write the Joint distribution of ., ,. ..........and x1, as a product of the chain conditional probabilities for the following causal network: v/N Xe Chop. 6 Exercises 125 6.6 Define the sentences 51. 521 and 53 as S F. S2 = Q. and 53 P -- Q. Determine the probabilistic truth values of s,, 52, and S3 when it is known that the probabilities of the possible worlds are given by P(W1) 1/4, P(W2) = 1/8, P(W1) = 118. and P(W4) = 1/2. 6.7 Write a LISP program that computes certainty factors for rules based on the ad hoc MYCIN model. 6.8 Dempster-Shafer computations were given for four terrorist organizations A. B, C, and D in Section 6.4. Suppose now that new evidence (m3) indicates that organization C was indeed responsible to a degree of 0.8. This requires that values for m30in4 be computed, where ,n4 m1 + m2. Compute a new intersect
