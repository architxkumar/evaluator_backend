BACKTRACKING The term backtracking search is used for a depth-first search that chooses values for
SEARCH
one variable atatime and backtracks when avariable has nolegal values left to assign. The
algorithmisshownin Figure6.5. Itrepeatedlychoosesanunassigned variable,andthentries

of the search tree forthe Australia problem is shown in Figure 6.6, where wehave assigned
variables in the order WA,NT,Q,.... Because the representation of CS Ps is standardized,
there is no need to supply BACKTRACKING-SEARCH with a domain-specific initial state,
actionfunction, transition model,orgoaltest.

In Chapter 3 we improved the poor performance of uninformed search algorithms by
supplying them with domain-specific heuristic functions derived from ourknowledge of the
problem. Itturnsoutthatwecansolve CS Psefficientlywithoutsuchdomain-specific knowl-
