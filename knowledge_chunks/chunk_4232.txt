 Many As several of the examples above have shown, the process of understanding a sentence is a search process in which a large universe of possible interpretations must be explored to find one that meets all the constraints imposed by a particular sentence.* As for any search process, we must decide whether to explore all possible paths or, instead, to explore only a single most likely one and to produce only the result of that one path as the answer. Suppose, for example, that a sentence processor looks at the words of an input sentence one at a time, from left to right, and suppose that so far, it has seen: Have the students who missed the exam There are two paths that the processor could be following at this point: Have is the main verb of an imperative sentence, such as Have the students who missed the exam take it today. e Have is an auxiliary verb of an interrogative sentence, such as Have the students who missed the exam taken it today? There are four ways of handling sentences such as these: All Paths Follow all possible paths and build all the possible intermediate components. Many of the components will later be ignored because the other inputs required to use them will not appear. For example, if the auxiliary verb interpretation of have in the previous example is built, it will be discarded if no participle, such as taken, ever appears. The major disadvantage of this approach is that, because it results in many spurious constituents being built and many deadend paths being followed, it can be very inefficient. 294 Artificial Intelligence Best Path with Backtracking Follow only one path at a time, but record, at every choice point, the information that is necessary to make another choice if the chosen path fails to lead to a complete interpretation of the sentence. In this example, if the auxiliary verb interpretation of have were chosen first and the end of the sentence appeared with no main verb having been seen, the understander would detect failure a
