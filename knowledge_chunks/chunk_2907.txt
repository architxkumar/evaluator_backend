common modifications are localization aids such as inductive loops in the floor, active bea-
cons, or barcode tags. An open challenge in robotics is the design of robots that can use

Robotic cars. Most of use cars every day. Many of us make cell phone calls while
driving. Some of us even text. The sad result: more than a million people die every year in
trafficaccidents. Robotic carslike BOSS and STANLEY offerhope: Notonlywilltheymake
