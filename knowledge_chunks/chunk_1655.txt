of the optimal decision once more, this time paying careful attention to what we know at
eachpoint intheprocess. Thestepsareexplained in Figure5.5. Theoutcome isthatwecan
identify theminimaxdecision withouteverevaluating twooftheleafnodes.
Anotherwaytolookatthisisasasimplification oftheformula for MINIMAX. Letthe
two unevaluated successors of node C in Figure 5.5 have values x and y. Then the value of
therootnodeisgivenby
MINIMAX(root) max(min(3,12,8),min(2,x,y),min(14,5,2)) max(3,min(2,x,y),2) max(3,z,2) wherez min(2,x,y) 2 3.
In otherwords, thevalue ofthe root and hence the minimax decision are independent of the
valuesoftheprunedleaves xandy.
Alpha beta pruning can be applied to trees of any depth, and it is often possible to
prune entire subtrees ratherthanjust leaves. Thegeneral principle isthis: consider anode n

(c) The third leaf below B has a value of 8; we have seen all B s successor states, so the
value of B is exactly 3. Now, we can inferthat the value of the rootis at least 3, because
MAX has a choice worth 3 at the root. (d) The first leaf below C has the value 2. Hence,
C, whichisa MIN node,hasavalueofatmost2. Butweknowthat B isworth3,so MAX
