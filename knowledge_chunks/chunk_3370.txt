When the value of this slot is evaluated, the fget function is activated. When fget finds no value for gas mileage it recursively looks for a value from ancestor frames until a value is found. The if-needed value in the Range slot is a procedure mme that, when called, computes the driving range of the Ford as a function of gas mileage and fuel capacity. Slots with attached procedures such as fget and if-needed are called procedural attachments or demons. They are done automatically when a value is needed but not provided for in a slot. Other types of demons include if-added and if-removed procedures. They would be triggered, for example, when a value is added or removed from a slot and other actions are needed such as updating slots in other dependent frames. Like associative networks, frames are usually linked together in a network through the use of special pointers such as the AKO pointer in Figure 7.8. Hierarchies of frames are typical for many systems where entities have supertype-subtype or generic-instance relationships. Such networks make it possible to easily implement property inheritance and default reasoning as depicted in Figure 7.8. This is illustrated (ford (AKO (VALUE car)) (COLOR (VALUE silver)) (MODEL (VALUE 4-do
