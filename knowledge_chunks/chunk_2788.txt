Formal semantic interpretation of natural languages originates within philosophy and
formallogic, particularly Alfred Tarski s(1935) workonthesemantics offormallanguages.
Bar-Hillel (1954) was the firstto consider the problems ofpragmatics and propose that they
could be handled by formal logic. For example, he introduced C. S. Peirce s (1902) term
indexical into linguistics. Richard Montague s essay English as a formal language (1970)
is a kind of manifesto for the logical analysis of language, but the books by Dowty et al.
(1991)and Portnerand Partee(2002)aremorereadable.

statistics. Closeafterthatwas Woods s (1973) LUNAR,whichanswered questions about the
rocks brought back from the moon by the Apollo program. Roger Schank and his students
built a series of programs (Schank and Abelson, 1977; Schank and Riesbeck, 1981) that
all had the task of understanding language. Modern approaches to semantic interpretation
usually assume that the mapping from syntax to semantics will be learned from examples
(Zelleand Mooney,1996;Zettlemoyerand Collins,2005).
Hobbsetal. (1993) describes aquantitative nonprobabilistic framework forinterpreta-
tion. More recent work follows an explicitly probabilistic framework (Charniak and Gold-
man, 1992; Wu, 1993; Franz, 1996). Inlinguistics, optimality theory (Kager, 1999) isbased
on the idea of building soft constraints into the grammar, giving a natural ranking to inter-
pretations (similartoaprobability distribution), ratherthan having thegrammargenerate all
possibilities with equal rank. Norvig (1988) discusses the problems of considering multiple
simultaneous interpretations, rather than settling for a single maximum-likelihood interpre-
tation. Literary critics
