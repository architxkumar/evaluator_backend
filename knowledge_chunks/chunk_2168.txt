these coins are normal, with heads on one side and tails on the other, whereas one coin is a
fake,withheadsonbothsides.

b. Suppose you continue flipping the coin for atotal of k times after picking it and see k
heads. Nowwhatistheconditional probability thatyoupickedthefakecoin?
c. Supposeyouwantedtodecidewhetherthechosencoinwasfakebyflippingitk times.
The decision procedure returns fake if all k flips come up heads; otherwise it returns
normal. Whatisthe(unconditional) probability thatthisprocedure makesanerror?
13.19 In this exercise, you will complete the normalization calculation for the meningitis

13.20 Let X, Y, Z be Boolean random variables. Label the eight entries in the joint dis-
tribution P(X,Y,Z) as a through h. Express the statement that X and Y are conditionally
independent given Z, as a set of equations relating a through h. How many nonredundant
equations arethere?
13.21 (Adapted from Pearl (1988).) Suppose you are a witness to a nighttime hit-and-run
accident involving a taxi in Athens. Alltaxis in Athens are blue orgreen. You swear, under
oath, that the taxi wasblue. Extensive testing showsthat, under thedim lighting conditions,
discrimination betweenblueandgreenis75 reliable.
a. Isitpossible tocalculate themostlikelycolorforthetaxi? (Hint: distinguish carefully
betweentheproposition thatthetaxiisblueandtheproposition thatitappearsblue.)
