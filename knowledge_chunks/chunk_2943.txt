your conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable
behaviorremainsthesame.(Searle,1992)
One can do more than argue from intuition. First, note that, for the external behavior to re-
mainthesamewhilethesubject gradually becomesunconscious, itmustbethecasethatthe
subject s volition is removed instantaneously and totally; otherwise the shrinking of aware-
nesswouldbereflectedinexternalbehavior Help, I mshrinking! orwordstothateffect.
This instantaneous removal of volition as a result of gradual neuron-at-a-time replacement
seemsanunlikely claimtohavetomake.
Second, consider what happens if we do ask the subject questions concerning his or
herconscious experience during the period when no real neurons remain. Bythe conditions
of the experiment, we will get responses such as I feel fine. I must say I m a bit surprised
