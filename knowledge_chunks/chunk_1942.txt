e, city of residence, date of birth, and mother of every person, using social se-
curity numbers as identifying constants for each person. Thus, George s age is given by
Age(443-65-1282,56). Which ofthe following indexing schemes S1 S5enable anefficient
solution forwhichofthequeries Q1 Q4(assuming normalbackwardchaining)? S1: anindexforeachatomineachposition. S2: anindexforeachfirstargument. S3: anindexforeachpredicate atom. S4: anindexforeachcombination ofpredicate andfirstargument.
Exercises 363 S5: an index for each combination of predicate and second argument and an index for
eachfirstargument. Q1: Age(443-44-4321,x) Q2: Resides In(x,Houston) Q3: Mother(x,y) Q4: Age(x,34) Resides In(x,Tiny Town USA)
9.12 One might suppose that we can avoid the problem of variable conflict in unification
during backward chaining by standardizing apart all of the sentences in the knowledge base
onceandforall. Showthat, forsomesentences, thisapproach cannot work. (Hint: Consider
asentence inwhichonepartunifieswithanother.)
9.13 In this exercise, use the sentences you wrote in Exercise 9.6 to answer a question by
usingabackward-chaining algorithm.
a. Draw the proof tree generated by an exhaustive backward-chaining algorithm for the
