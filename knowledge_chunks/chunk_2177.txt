Intuitively, the parents of node X i should contain all those nodes in X 1 , ..., X i 1 that
directly influence X . For example, suppose we have completed the network in Figure 14.2

of the domain tells us that these events influence Mary s calling behavior only through their

Thus,Alarm willbetheonlyparentnodefor Mary Calls.

Compactnessandnodeordering
Aswellasbeingacompleteandnonredundant representation ofthedomain,a Bayesiannet-

STRUCTURED
In a locally structured system, each subcomponent interacts directly with only a bounded

number ofother components, regardless ofthe total number of components. Local structure
isusually associated withlinearratherthanexponential growthincomplexity. Inthecaseof
Bayesian networks, it is reasonable to suppose that in most domains each random variable
is directly influenced by at most k others, fo
