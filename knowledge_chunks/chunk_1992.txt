Long,1998),and SGP(Weldetal.,1998),soonfollowed. Adatastructurecloselyresembling

IXTET partial-order planner used it to derive accurate heuristics to guide searches. Nguyen
et al. (2001) thoroughly analyze heuristics derived from planning graphs. Ourdiscussion of
planning graphs is based partly on this work and on lecture notes and articles by Subbarao
Kambhampati (Bryce and Kambhampati, 2007). As mentioned in the chapter, a planning
graph can be used in many different ways to guide the search for a solution. The winner
of the 2002 AIPS planning competition, LPG (Gerevini and Serina, 2002, 2003), searched
planning graphsusingalocalsearchtechnique inspired by WALKSAT.
Thesituation calculus approach toplanning wasintroduced by John Mc Carthy(1963).

Kautzet al. (1996) investigated various ways to propositionalize action schemas, find-
ing that the most compact forms did not necessarily lead to the fastest solution times. A
systematic analysis was carried out by Ernst et al. (1997), who also developed an auto-
matic compiler for generating propositional representations from PDDL problems. The
BLACKBOX planner, which combines ideas from GRAPHPLAN and SATPLAN, was devel-
oped by Kautz and Selman (1998). CPLAN, a planner based on constraint satisfaction, was
described byvan Beekand Chen(1999).
