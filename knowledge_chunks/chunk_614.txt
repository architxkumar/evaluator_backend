for a domain with two toilets t1 and t2, which are not clogged in the given state. Show that a conformant solution for the bomb diffusing problem can be found by CGP. 18. Extend the matching diagram of Figure 10.13 to include connections for the actions Stack(A, C) and PtDn(A). Draw the domains for the new variables as and when needed. Hold(left, ball) HandFree(right) . Hold(left, ball!) Hold(right, ball), HandFree(left) HandFree(right) , Hold(right, ball!) : HandFree(left) - ThrowRight(balll) Hold(right, ball!) Hold(left, ball) HandFree(right) HandFree(left) ThrowRight(balll) FIGURE 10.33 The two actions ThrowLeft(ball1) and ThrowRight(ball2) and the relations between them. Shown below is a sequence of actions representing a ball being thrown from one hand to the other alternately. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. In the MPT representation used in Fast Downward, pose the blocks world problem such that the variable Holding(arm) is a derived variable, which can take values from A, B, C, ni . Draw the domain transition graph for this variable when there are three blocks A, B and C, in a planning problem. Draw the causal graph for the planning domain depicted in Figure 10.18. Model the operator for driving a car from a point A to a point Bas a durative action with metric fluents. Assume that distance from A to B is given, the (average) speed of the car, and the rate of guzzling fuel is known. The spy-swap problem. Two unnamed countries have a desire to swap two spies named Black and White. Black is being held at location M, while White is a prisoner at location N. The swap is to take place on a bridge B over a river that divides the areas controlled by the two countries. B is reachable from M and N over a road network, available as a graph weighted with distances. It takes five minutes to walk across the bridge. Being suspicious of each other, the countries would like Black and White to walk across at the same time. Pose the above problem as a temporal planning problem. Given i
