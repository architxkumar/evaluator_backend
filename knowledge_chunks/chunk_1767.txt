The inference algorithm illustrated in Figure 7.5 is called model checking, because it enu-

The property of completeness is also desirable: an inference algorithm is complete if

it can derive any sentence that is entailed. For real haystacks, which are finite in extent,
it seems obvious that a systematic examination can always decide whether the needle is in
thehaystack. Formanyknowledge bases, however, thehaystack ofconsequences isinfinite,
and completeness becomes an important issue.5 Fortunately, there are complete
