8.3.4 The wumpus world
Some propositional logic axioms for the wumpus world were given in Chapter 7. The first-
orderaxioms inthis section aremuch moreconcise, capturing inanatural wayexactly what
wewanttosay.
Recall that the wumpus agent receives a percept vector with fiveelements. The corre-
spondingfirst-ordersentencestoredintheknowledgebasemustincludeboththeperceptand
thetimeatwhichitoccurred; otherwise,theagentwillgetconfused aboutwhenitsawwhat.
Weuseintegersfortimesteps. Atypicalperceptsentence wouldbe
Percept( Stench,Breeze,Glitter,None,None ,5).
Here,Percept isabinary predicate, and Stench andsoonareconstants placedinalist. The
actionsinthewumpusworldcanberepresented bylogicalterms:
Turn(Right), Turn(Left), Forward, Shoot, Grab, Climb .
Todetermine whichisbest,theagentprogram executesthequery
ASKVARS( a Best Action(a,5)),
which returns a binding list such as a Grab . The agent program can then return Grab as
the action to take. The raw percept data implies certain facts about the current state. For
example: t,s,g,m,c Percept( s,Breeze,g,m,c ,t) Breeze(t), t,s,b,m,c Percept( s,b,Glitter,m,c ,t) Glitter(t),
