There has been arecent resurgence of interest in Bayesian models of cognition, overturning
decadesofpessimism (Oaksfordand Chater,1998;Elio,2002;Chaterand Oaksford,2008).
Keeney and Raiffa (1976) give a thorough introduction to multiattribute utility the-
ory. They describe early computer implementations of methods for eliciting the necessary
parameters for a multiattribute utility function and include extensive accounts of real appli-
cations of the theory. In AI, the principal reference for MAUT is Wellman s (1985) paper,
which includes a system called URP (Utility Reasoning Package) that can use a collection
of statements about preference independence and conditional independence to analyze the
structure of decision problems. The use of stochastic dominance together with qualitative
probability models was investigated extensively by Wellman (1988, 1990a). Wellman and
Doyle (1992) provide apreliminary sketch of how acomplex set of utility-independence re-
lationships might be used to provide a structured model of a utility function, in much the
same way that Bayesian networks provide a structured model of joint probability distribu-
tions. Bacchusand Grove(1995, 1996)and La Muraand Shoham(1999)givefurtherresults
