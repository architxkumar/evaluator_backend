In the SELECT phase, the best descendent of a candidate is found based on the optimistic value, revising the target value on the way. Since the opponent will try and drive the value in the opposite direction, the phase VERIFY attempts to refute that the node is indeed a good one. In the SELECT phase, MAX acts as a forcer and the search attempts to find the most optimistic move that is likely to achieve the target value. B proceeds with the SELECT phase till the real value of a node becomes better than optimistic values of all its siblings that have the probability of achieving the target higher than a value known as minAct. Initially, minAct is chosen as 0.15 but it may be increased later in search to enable higher pruning. After the SELECT phase is over, let the real value of the second best sibling be a value X. The verify phase is called with a target value of (X 1), and it computes the probabilities of this target value. If the probability of the chosen node having this revised target is high then the VERIFIER has demonstrated that the chosen move is not the best, and a new SELECT phase will begin. In the VERIFY phase, MIN acts as the forcer and tries its best moves to show that MAX s move is not the best one. If it succeeds, a new attempt by MAX will be embarked upon in another SELECT phase. If it fails, then search can terminate. In the SELECT phase, the search proceeds from the root, selecting the best optimistic value at MAX level and the best real value at MIN levels. When it terminates, the VERIFY phase begins selecting nodes with the criteria of nodes reversed, starting at the chosen node. The two phases continue
