t lines. The first major effort at creating a hand eye machine was Hein-
rich Ernst s MH-1,describedinhis MIT Ph.D.thesis(Ernst,1961). The Machine Intelligence
project at Edinburgh also demonstrated an impressive early system for vision-based assem-
bly called FREDDY (Michie, 1972). After these pioneering efforts, a great deal of work fo-
cused on geometric algorithms fordeterministic and fully observable motion planning prob-
lems. The PSPACE-hardness of robot motion planning was shown in a seminal paper by
Reif(1979). Theconfiguration spacerepresentation isdueto Lozano-Perez (1983). Aseries

bility graphs (Wesley and Lozano-Perez, 1979). Guibas et al. (1992) developed efficient

techniques for calculating Voronoi diagrams incrementally, and Choset (1996) generalized
Voronoi diagrams tobroader motion-planning problems. John Canny (1988) established the
firstsingly exponential algorithm formotion planning. The seminal text by Latombe (1991)

La Valle(2006). Kavrakietal.(1996) developed probabilistic roadmaps, whicharecurrently
one of the most effective methods. Fine-motion planning with limited sensing was investi-
gated by Lozano-Perez et al. (1984) and Canny and Reif (1987). Landmark-based naviga-
tion (Lazanas and Latombe, 1992) uses many of the same ideas in the mobile robot arena.
