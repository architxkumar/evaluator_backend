Checkers was the first of the classic games fully played by a computer. Christopher
Strachey (1952) wrote the first working program for checkers. Beginning in 1952, Arthur
Samuel of IBM, working in his spare time, developed a checkers program that learned its
own evaluation function by playing itself thousands of times (Samuel, 1959, 1967). We
describe this idea in more detail in Chapter 21. Samuel s program began as a novice but
after only a few days self-play had improved itself beyond Samuel s own level. In 1962 it
defeated Robert Nealy, a champion at blind checkers, through an error on his part. When
one considers that Samuel s computing equipment (an IBM 704) had 10,000 words of main

right to challenge forthe world championship. It then ran up against a problem, in the form
of Marion Tinsley. Dr. Tinsley had been world champion for over 40 years, losing only

official world champion. Schaeffer kept on building on his database of endgames, and
