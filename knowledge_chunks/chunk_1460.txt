We begin by examining agents, environments, and the coupling between them. The

agent one that behaves as well as possible. How well an agent can behave depends on
the nature of the environment; some environments are more difficult than others. We give a
crude categorization of environments and show how properties of an environment influence
thedesignofsuitableagentsforthatenvironment. Wedescribe anumberofbasic skeleton agentdesigns, whichwefleshoutintherestofthebook.

and various motors for actuators. A software agent receives keystrokes, file contents, and
network packets as sensory inputs and acts on the environment by displaying on the screen,
