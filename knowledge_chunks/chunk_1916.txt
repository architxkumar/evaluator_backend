queries. Forexample, instead ofdepth-first, left-to-right backtracking, theymightuseanyof
the more efficient algorithms discussed in Chapter 6, including heuristic conjunct ordering,
backjumping, cutset conditioning, and so on. CLP systems therefore combine elements of
constraint satisfaction algorithms, logicprogramming, anddeductive databases.
Several systems that allow the programmer more control over the search order for in-
ferencehavebeendefined. The MRS language(Genesereth and Smith,1981;Russell,1985)
allows the programmer to write metarules to determine which conjuncts are tried first. The
METARULE
user could write a rule saying that the goal with the fewest variables should be tried first or
couldwritedomain-specific rulesforparticularpredicates.

9.5.1 Conjunctive normal form forfirst-order logic
As in the propositional case, first-order resolution requires that sentences be in conjunctive
normalform(CNF) thatis,aconjunction ofclauses, whereeachclauseisadisjunction of
literals.6 Literals can contain variables, which are assumed tobe universally quantified. For
example,thesentence x American(x) Weapon(y) Sells(x,y,z) Hostile(z) Criminal(x)
becomes, in CNF, American(x) Weapon(y) Sells(x,y,z) Hostile(z) Criminal(x).
Every sentence of first-order logic can be converted into an inferentially equivalent CNF
sentence. Inparticular,the CN Fsentencewillbeunsatisfiablejustwhentheoriginalsentence
