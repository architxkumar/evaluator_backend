 D), T) D Happens(ride(P, B, S, D), i) The reason we have set up these elaborate inferences is because in our story, we have only said that Nikhil has an intention or plan to ride the bicycle to the restaurant. His plan will fructify only if the necessary conditions hold, for example that his bicycle tyres remain inflated. The domain axiom Ag2 is saying that if such conditions are satisfied then a plan to ride the bike is workable. A3 says that if a plan is workable then it will happen. Axiom Aq states that if the ride event happens then the person P will be at the destination D. We have assumed this to happen instantaneously, but the reader is encouraged to write a temporal version of these axioms in which actions are durative. Ag: Initiates(ride(P, B, S, D), loc(P, D), T) Likewise if the ride event happens the person ceases to be at the source. As: (S D) D Terminates(ride(P, B, S, D), loc(P, S), T) Axiom Ag considers the preconditions for the eating at the restaurant plan to work, which we have taken only to be at the restaurant. In practice we will need more conditions like the customer has money. Ag: HoldsAt(loc(P, R), T)) Initiates(planToEat(P, R), worksPlanEat(P, R), T) Axiom A7 is the trigger axiom for the eating event. Note that every intention (plan or action) that has preconditions will need such a trigger action. Az: HoldsAt(WorksPlanEat(P, R), T) Happens(eat(P, R), T) We assume that 7 Released(f to) holds for all fluents to start with. This means that fluents can change value only if they are affected by some events that happen. The derivation of the HoldsAt(loc(Nikhil53, cricketPractice11), t)) for the narrative N, is as follows, 14. HoldsAt(inflated(bicycle39), t,) From EC,, A; and 2 15. HoldsAt(inflated(bicycle39), t3) From 14 and law of inertia 16. HoldsAt(loc(nikhil53, homesg6, t3) From 1 and law of inertia 17.
