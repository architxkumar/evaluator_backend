Hazardous environments. Robots have assisted people in cleaning up nuclear waste,
most notably in Chernobyl and Three Mile Island. Robots were present after the collapse
of the World Trade Center, where they entered structures deemed too dangerous for human
searchandrescuecrews.
Somecountries haveused robots totransport ammunition and todefuse bombs a no-
toriously dangerous task. A number of research projects are presently developing prototype
robots for clearing minefields, on land and at sea. Most existing robots for these tasks are
teleoperated a human operates them by remote control. Providing such robots with auton-
omyisanimportant nextstep.
Exploration. Robots have gone where no one has gone before, including the surface
of Mars (see Figure 25.2(b) and the cover). Robotic arms assist astronauts in deploying
and retrieving satellites and in building the International Space Station. Robots also help
