The CLASSIC language(Borgida etal.,1989)isatypicaldescription logic. Thesyntax
of CLASSIC descriptions is shown in Figure 12.7.6 For example, to say that bachelors are
unmarriedadultmaleswewouldwrite
Bachelor And(Unmarried,Adult,Male).
Theequivalent infirst-orderlogicwouldbe
Bachelor(x) Unmarried(x) Adult(x) Male(x).
Notice that the description logic has an an algebra of operations on predicates, which of
coursewecan tdoinfirst-orderlogic. Anydescription in CLASSIC canbetranslated intoan
equivalent first-order sentence, but some descriptions are more straightforward in CLASSIC.
For example, to describe the set of men with at least three sons who are all unemployed
and married to doctors, and at mosttwodaughters who areall professors in physics ormath
departments, wewoulduse
And(Man,At Least(3,Son),At Most(2,Daughter),
All(Son,And(Unemployed,Married,All(Spouse,Doctor))),
All(Daughter,And(Professor,Fills(Department,Physics,Math)))).
