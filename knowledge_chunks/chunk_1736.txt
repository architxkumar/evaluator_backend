No-goods can be effectively used by forward checking orby backjumping. Constraint
learning is one of the most important techniques used by modern CSP solvers to achieve
efficiencyoncomplexproblems.

Localsearchalgorithms(see Section4.1)turnouttobeeffectiveinsolvingmany CS Ps. They
use a complete-state formulation: the initial state assigns a value to every variable, and the
searchchangesthevalueofonevariableatatime. Forexample,inthe8-queensproblem(see
Figure 4.3), the initial state might be a random configuration of 8 queens in 8 columns, and
each step moves a single queen to a new position in its column. Typically, the initial guess
