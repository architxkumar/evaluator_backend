Modernanalyticphilosophyhastypicallyacceptedphysicalism,butthevarietyofviews
on the content of mental states is bewildering. Theidentification of mental states with brain
states is usually attributed to Place (1956) and Smart (1959). The debate between narrow-
contentandwide-contentviewsofmentalstateswastriggeredby Hilary Putnam(1975),who
introduced so-called twin earths (rather than brain-in-a-vat, as we did in the chapter) as a

Functionalism isthephilosophy ofmindmostnaturally suggested by AI.Theideathat
mental states correspond to classes of brain states defined functionally is due to Putnam
(1960, 1967) and Lewis (1966, 1980). Perhaps the most forceful proponent of functional-
ism is Daniel Dennett, whose ambitiously titled work Consciousness Explained (Dennett,
1991)hasattractedmanyattemptedrebuttals. Metzinger(2009)arguesthereisnosuchthing
asanobjective self, thatconsciousness isthesubjective appearance ofaworld. Theinverted
spectrum argument concerning qualia was introduced by John Locke (1690). Frank Jack-
son (1982) designed aninfluential thought experiment involving Mary, acolor scientist who
has been brought up in an entirely black-and-white world. There s Something About Mary

Functionalism hascomeunderattack from authors whoclaim thattheydonotaccount
for the qualia or what it s like aspect of mental states (Nagel, 1974). Searle has focused
instead on the alleged inability of functionalism to account for intentionality (Searle, 1980,
1984, 1992). Churchland and Churchland (1982) rebut both these types of criticism. The
Chinese Room has been debated endlessly (Searle, 1980, 1990; Preston and Bishop, 2002).
