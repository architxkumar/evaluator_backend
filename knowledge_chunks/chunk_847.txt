t Gap for PAM to test in the Predictive mode. If it matches an expectation, PAM goes into the Incorporation mode. We look at a small example described in (Wilensky, 1981) of how PAM processes sentences. The two sentences are, John was hungry. He ate at a restaurant. ELI produces the following conceptualization for the first sentence, ((ACTOR HUMO IS ( HUNGER VAL (-3)))) This is a state description, and does not meet any expectation. PAM goes into the Bottom-up mode and searches for a request that has the hungry state as a pattern or condition. It finds the following, HUNGER-RULE Condition: ((ACTOR HUMO IS ( HUNGER VAL (-3)))) Action: ADD GOAL: S-HUNGER PLANNER ( ) SOURCE: THEME HUNGER-DRIVE PLAN: ( ) Suggestions: Set TARGET PLAN To FOCUS ! INPUT! Using SUITABLE-PLAN-RULE Set TARGET PLANNER of GOAL To FOCUS ACTOR Using FOCUS-REQ PAM applies the rule and places the following conceptualization in the Input gap, (S-HUNGER PLANNER () SOURCE THEME HUNGER-DRIVE PLAN ()) The source of the goal S-HUNGER is the theme HUNGER-DRIVE. A theme is something that PAM accepts as something that happens in a recurring manner. It does not need any further explaining. People have needs that need to be periodically satisfied, and hunger is one of them. The S prefix signifies that it is a satisfaction goal. For goals that derive from themes, PAM seeks no further explanation. It goes into the incorporation mode, and adds the S-HUNGER goal to the story. Observe that there are two empty s ots or gaps in the added structure, the ones named PLANNER and PLAN. PAM activates requests called suggestions to fill these slots. The first suggestion in the HUNGER-RULE is, Set TARGET PLAN To FOCUS !INPUT! Using SUITABLE-PLAN-RULE This says that the gap or target of this request is the PLAN gap. The FOCUS is the Input gap, which means that PAM should look for the filler in the Input gap, and finally the filler should describe an appropriate plan for satisfying the hunger goal. The second suggestion is, Se
