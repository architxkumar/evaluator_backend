Shapematchingisatechniquefromcomputervisionusedtoaligncorrespondingparts
of two different images of objects (Belongie et al., 2002). The idea is to pick out a set
of points in each of the two images, and then compute, for each point in the first image,
which point in the second image itcorresponds to. From this alignment, wethen compute a
transformation between the images. The transformation gives us a measure of the distance
betweentheimages. Thisdistancemeasureisbettermotivatedthanjustcountingthenumber
of differing pixels, and it turns out that a 3 nearest neighbor algorithm using this distance
measure performs very well. Training on only 20,000 of the 60,000 digits, and using 100
sample points per image extracted from a Canny edge detector, a shape matching classifier
achieved0.63 testerror.
Humansareestimatedtohaveanerrorrateofabout0.2 onthisproblem. Thisfigure
is somewhat suspect because humans have not been tested as extensively as have machine
learning algorithms. On a similar data set of digits from the United States Postal Service,
humanerrorswereat2.5 .
The following figure summarizes the error rates, run time performance, memory re-
quirements, and amount oftraining timeforthe seven algorithms wehave discussed. Italso
adds another measure, the percentage of digits that must be rejected to achieve 0.5 error.
For example, if the SVM is allowed to reject 1.8 of the inputs that is, pass them on for
someone else to make the final judgment then its error rate on the remaining 98.2 of the
inputsisreduced from1.1 to0.5 .
The following table summarizes the error rate and some of the other characteristics of
theseventechniques wehavediscussed.
