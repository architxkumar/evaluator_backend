e computations as one of the exercises at the end of this chapter. We return now to the methods of edge detection which employ smoothing followed by an application of the gradient. For this, the Continuous case is considered first.

The Continuous analog of discrete smoothing in one dimension is the convolution of two functions land g (writtenf * g) where h(y) = f * g = ffix)g(y - x)dx Convolving the two functions f and g is similar to computing the cross con-elation, a process that reduces random noise and enhances coherent or structural changes. One particular form of weighting function g has a symmetric bell shape or normal form, that is the Gaussian distribution. The two dimensional form of this function is given by g(u,v) = ce2*2)2 where c is a normalizing constant. Because of their rotational symmetry, Gaussian filters produce desirable effects 1 0 1 1 0 1 P,.= 1 0 1 S 2 0 2 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 p,= o 0 sr= 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 Figure 14.9 Generalized edge detection Prewitt Masks Sobel Masks masks. - 296 Visual Iffige Understanding Chap. 14 $J'UJ I_ image Gradient Second order Gradient applied intensity gradient to convolution Figure 14.10 Application of Gaussian and second degree differential operators. as an edge detector when followed by an appiication of the second degree differential (gradient) operator. Over discontinuous regions, the transformed intensity results in a zero crossing as depicted in Figure 14.10. The smoothing and differencing operations may be combined into a single operator and approximated with a digital mask of the types given above (Marr and Hildreth, 1980). There is some psychological evidence to support the belief that the human eye uses a form of Gaussian transformation called Lateral inhibition which has the effect of enhancing the contrast between
