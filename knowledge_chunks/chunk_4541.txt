on ensues. Niching and Speciation augment the capability of the other operators in locating multiple optima (multi-modal search) as also in maintaining an increased diversity in the population. 472 Artificial Intelligence 23.6 EVOLVING NEURAL NETWORKS Though neural networks have been used in a wide variety of applications, they suffer from some basic drawbacks. We look at two of the major problems faced while using artificial neural networks and see how genetic algorithms can be used to overcome them. (a) Network Topology Selection The very first problem one encounters while dealing with artificial neural networks is that of topology selection. How do we know that a particular network configuration (in terms of layers and neurons per layer) is the best? Most of the time the network configuration is decided based on some personal thumb rules or heuristics pertaining to the problem at hand. As always, the search for a solution in the world of GA begins with some known solutions, which in this case is a set of network topologies which are encoded in a chromosome. One possibly way of structuring the chromosome is shown below: Input Hidden Output Layer I Layer H Layer O 1 I2 Hi H2 H3 H4 O 4 7o 0 4114 1 1 0 2/0 0 1 14 1 1 0 H1/0 0 0 0 0 0 4 H2/0 0 00 00 1 H3/0 0 00 00 1 44/0 0 00 0 0 1 0/0 0 090 00 0 Row |1 Row I2 Row H1 , Row H4 Row 0 0011110 0011110 | 0000001 0000001 | 0000001 Fig. 23.11 A Typical Artificial Neural Network and a Possible Method of Representing its Weights as a Chromosome Figure 23.11 shows the manner in which the various neurons in the layers are connected. A 1 indicates a connection while a 0 indicates otherwise. Note that use of such a chromosome does limit the search to a finite number of neurons. One may increase the number of layers which will make the chromosome to contain longer sequences. We must bear in mind that the more the information contained within the chromosome, the more the computational time required to complete the search. Now that t
