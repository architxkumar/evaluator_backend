3.4 Show that the 8-puzzle states are divided into two disjoint sets, such that any state is
reachable from any other state in the same set, while no state is reachable from any state in
theotherset. (Hint: See Berlekamp etal. (1982).) Deviseaprocedure todecide whichset a

3.5 Consider the n-queens problem using the effi cient incremental formulation given on
page 72. Explain why the state space has at least 3 n! states and estimate the largest n for
