we do a crossover after four segments, we get the two offspring: C; (2,4, 7, 1, 6, 8, 1,9, 3), and Cy (4, 5, 7, 2, 5, 9, 8, 3.6) Neither of the two offspring is a valid tour because cities repeat in them. We need crossover operators that will retain the n cities and only introduce a different order. Some interesting crossovers that have been tried out (Michalewicz and Fogel, 2004) are as follows. The Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX) builds a child as follows. It chooses a random subsequence from one parent, and fills in the remaining tour by maintaining the order and position of cities as in the other parent. For the above example, choosing the subsequences from fourth to seventh city gives the children. Cy (x, x, x, 1, 5, 9, 8, x, x), and C2 (x, x, x, 2, 6, 8, 1, x, X) This defines a series of mappings (1-2), (5 6), (9 8) and (8 1). Next, the cities that can be copied from the other parent are brought in to give C; (4,x, 7, 1,5, 9, 8, x, 3), and Co (x, 4, 7, 2, 6, 8, 1, 3, X) Finally, the four x s in the above children are replaced by 6 (from the mapping (5 6) because 5 should have been there), 1 (from the mappings (998) and (8 1), 9 (from (1 32), (8 01) and (8 9) it should have been 2, but since 2 is already there 1, but since 1 is also there 8, and since 8 is already there 9), and 5, to give the two offspring C; (4, 6, 7, 1, 5, 9, 8, 6, 3), and Cy (9, 4, 7, 2, 6, 8, 1,3, 5) In Order Crossover (OX), we copy a substring from one parent as in PMX, but fill in the remaining nodes in the order they occur in the other parent. Starting with Cy (x, x, x, 1, 5, 9, 8, x, x), and Co (x, x, x, 2, 6, 8, 1, x, x) the remaining cities for C,are arranged in order as in P2 (4, 5, 7, 2, 6, 8, 1, 9, 3) giving (4, 7, 2, 6, 3). Likewise for the other child, the remaining cities are arranged in the order of P, giving the two offspring C, (1, 5, 9, 8, 4, 7, 2, 6, 3) and Cz (2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 3) In Cycle Crossover (CX), the attempt is made to inherit the position of each city in t
