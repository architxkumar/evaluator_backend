of a surface is much better understood. Essentially, this can be done in terms of curvature:
howdoesthesurface normalchangeasonemovesindifferentdirections onthesurface? For
a plane, there is no change at all. For a cylinder, if one moves parallel to the axis, there is
no change, but in the perpendicular direction, the surface normal rotates at a rate inversely
proportional to the radius of the cylinder, and so on. All this is studied in the subject called
differential geometry.
