NATURAL LANGUAGE

naturallanguage.

Of course, there are other attributes that are uniquely human: no other species wears
clothes, creates representational art, or watches three hours of television a day. But when
Alan Turing proposed his Test (see Section 1.1.1), he based it on language, not art or TV.
There are two main reasons why we want our computer agents to be able to process natural
languages: first,tocommunicatewithhumans,atopicwetakeupin Chapter23,andsecond,
toacquire information fromwrittenlanguage, thefocusofthischapter.
There are over a trillion pages of information on the Web, almost all of it in natural
