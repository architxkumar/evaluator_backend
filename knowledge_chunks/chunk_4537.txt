The curves clearly indicate that the possible optimum is reachable with crossover and mutation probabilities 0.6 and 0.09 respectively with a population size of 40. The graphs put together reveal the nature of the search space and provide vital clues for fixing the GA parameters. It is thus essential that every GA implementation be preceded by such a study of the search space. Readers are cautioned that many problems may not reveal a good picture of the search space but such plots 470 Artificial Intelligence will definitely provide insights which in turn will aid in choosing the GA parameters viz. p,, p,, and the population size.

This is ensured because the probability distributions of the fitter ones are higher. Even if it is not initially so, it will happen over generations. Reproduction thus ensures that only the fittest of the available solutions mate to form offsprings. The characteristics of the fittest ones are thus preserved in some way in the next generation. In the domain of the searches this is akin to searching those areas where the yield is currently high. In an n-dimensional search space, reproduction will force the GA to search that area which has highest fitness values. Crossover If no cross over is performed then the offsprings would be exact copies of the parents with no improvements or variat
