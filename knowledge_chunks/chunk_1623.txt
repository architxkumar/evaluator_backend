With nondetermnistic actions the PREDICT step grows the belief state, but the UPDATE step
shrinks it back down as long as the percepts provide some useful identifying information.
Sometimes the percepts don t help much for localization: If there were one or more long
east-west corridors, then a robot could receive a long sequence of NS percepts, but never
knowwhereinthecorridor(s) itwas.

So far we have concentrated on agents that use offline search algorithms. They compute
