-Agent Systems (AAMAS).Thejournal
Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems was founded in 1998. Finally, Dung Beetle
Ecology (Hanski and Cambefort, 1991) provides a wealth of interesting information on the
behaviorofdungbeetles. You Tubefeatures inspiring video recordings oftheiractivities.
EXERCISES
2.1 Suppose that the performance measure is concerned with just the first T time steps of
the environment and ignores everything thereafter. Show that a rational agent s action may
dependnotjustonthestateoftheenvironment butalsoonthetimestepithasreached.
2.2 Letusexaminetherationality ofvariousvacuum-cleaner agentfunctions.
a. Show that the simple vacuum-cleaner agent function described in Figure 2.3 is indeed
rationalundertheassumptions listedonpage38.
