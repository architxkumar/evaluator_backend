Segmentation based purely on low-level, local attributes such as brightness and color
cannot be expected to deliver the final correct boundaries of all the objects in the scene. To
reliably find object boundaries we need high-level knowledge of the likely kinds of objects
inthescene. Representing thisknowledge isatopicofactiveresearch. Apopularstrategy is
to produce an over-segmentation of animage, containing hundreds of homogeneous regions
known as superpixels. From there, knowledge-based algorithms can take over; they will

example, baseballs vary rather little in appearance; all of the objects in the category look
about the same under most circumstances. In this case, we can compute a set of features

Testing each class of images with a learned classifier is an important general recipe.
It works extremely well for faces looking directly at the camera, because at low resolution
and underreasonable lighting, allsuch faces look quite similar. Theface isround, and quite
