the knowledge that friends (usually) chat with each other. We assume the Friend relation is symmetric. Consider the following first order logic knowledge base, KB: Vx Vy (Priend(x,y) D FPriend(y,x)) Vx Vy (Friend(x,y) D Chat(x,y)) Friend(aditi, shubhgata), Friend(aditi, jennifer), Friend(jennifer, vinayak), Friend(shubagata, subun) Then the procedure under the closed world assumption augments the knowledge base KB, to create a new knowledge base KB, by adding negative atomic sentences where it can. KB, : Wx Vy (Friend(x,y) D Friend(y,x)) Vx Vy (Friend(x,y) Chat (x,y)) Friend(aditi, shubhgata), Friend(aditi, jennifer), Friend (jennifer, vinayak), Friend(shubagata, subun), aFriend(aditi, vinayak), -Friend(aditi, subun), aFriend(vinayak, subun) aFriend(subun, vinayak), Priend(subun, aditi), -Friend(subun, jennifer), aFriend(shubhagata, vinayak), 7Friend(shubhagata, jennifer), iend(jennifer, subun), -Friend(jennifer, shubhagata), aFriend(vinayak, aditi), Friend(vinayak, shubhagata), aChat(aditi, vinayak), Chat(aditi, subun), Chat (vinayak, subun) aChat (subun, vinayak), -Chat(subun, aditi), 7Chat(subun, jennifer), aChat (shubhagata, vinayak), Chat (shubhagata, jennifer), nChat (jennifer, subun), Chat (jennifer, shubhagata) aChat (vinayak, aditi), 7Chat(vinayak, shubhagata) The set of sentences one is entitled to believe in under the Closed World Assumption (CWA) are the sentences that are entailed by KB, . In fact, we can define a new notion of entailment under CWA as follows, KBEqyG iff KBEQ where KB? is defined as, KB KB U -P P is a ground atomic formula and KB P Reasoning under the closed world assumption is thus based on the premise that all ground atomic formulas that are true have been asserted in the knowledge base, or are entailed in it. Recall that the model for a set of sentences in a language is a domain and an interpretation such that all the sentences are true in that domain under the interpretation (see Chapter 12). The interpretation of a predicate is a r
