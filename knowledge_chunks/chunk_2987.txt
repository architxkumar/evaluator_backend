crete definition: avectorisanordered sequence ofvalues. Forexample, intwo-dimensional
space, we have vectors such as x (cid:16)3,4(cid:17) and y (cid:16)0,2(cid:17). We follow the convention of bold-
face characters for vector names, although some authors use arrows or bars over the names:

The two fundamental operations on vectors are vector addition and scalar multiplica-
tion. Thevectoradditionx yistheelementwisesum: x y (cid:16)3 0,4 2(cid:17) (cid:16)3,6(cid:17). Scalar

The length of a vector is denoted x(cid:10) and is computed by taking the square root of the
sumofthesquares oftheelements: x (32 42) 5. Thedotproduct x y(also called
scalar product) of two vectors is the sum of the products of corresponding elements, that is,

Vectors are often interpreted as directed line segments (arrows) in an n-dimensional
Euclidean space. Vector addition is then equivalent to placing the tail of one vector at the
head of the other, and the dot product x y is equal to x y cos , where is the angle

A matrix is a rectangular array of values arranged into rows and columns. Here is a
