The propositional logic representation of planning problems also has limitations, such
as the fact that the notion of time is tied directly to fluents. For example, South2 means the agent is facing south at time 2. With that representation, there is no way to say the
agentwouldbefacingsouth attime2ifitexecuted aright turnattime1;otherwiseitwould
be facing east. First-order logic lets us get around this limitation by replacing the notion
of linear time with a notion of branching situations, using a representation called situation
SITUATION calculusthatworkslikethis:
CALCULUS The initial state is called a situation. If s is a situation and a is an action, then
SITUATION
RESULT(s,a) is also a situation. There are no other situations. Thus, a situation cor-
responds to a sequence, or history, of actions. You can also think of a situation as the

and actions are the same: (RESULT(s,a) RESULT(s (cid:2) ,a (cid:2) )) (s s (cid:2) a a (cid:2) ).
