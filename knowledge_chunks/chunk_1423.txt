computers have a cycle time that is a million times faster than a brain. The brain makes up
for that with far more storage and interconnection than even a high-end personal computer,
although the largest supercomputers have a capacity that is similar to the brain s. (It should
be noted, however, that the brain does not seem to use all of its neurons simultaneously.)
Futurists make much of these numbers, pointing to an approaching singularity at which

1.2.5 Psychology Howdohumansandanimalsthinkandact?
The origins of scientific psychology are usually traced to the work of the German physi-
cist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821 1894) and his student Wilhelm Wundt (1832 1920).
Helmholtz applied the scientific method to the study of human vision, and his Handbook
of Physiological Optics is even now described as the single most important treatise on the
physics and physiology of human vision (Nalwa, 1993, p.15). In 1879, Wundt opened the
first laboratory of experimental psychology, at
