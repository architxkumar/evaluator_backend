Personal Services. Service is an up-and-coming application domain of robotics. Ser-
vice robots assist individuals in performing daily tasks. Commercially available domestic
service robots include autonomous vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers, and golf caddies. The
world s most popular mobile robot is a personal service robot: the robotic vacuum cleaner
Roomba, shown in Figure 25.30(a). More than three million Roombas have been sold.

Other service robots operate in public places, such as robotic information kiosks that
have been deployed in shopping malls and trade fairs, or in museums as tour guides. Ser-
vice tasks require human interaction, and theability tocoperobustly withunpredictable and

Entertainment. Robots have begun to conquer the entertainment and toy industry.
In Figure 25.6(b) we see robotic soccer, a competitive game very much like human soc-

cer, but played with autonomous mobile robots. Robot soccer provides great opportunities
for research in AI, since it raises a range of problems relevant to many other, more serious
robot applications. Annual robotic soccer competitions have attracted large numbers of AI

Human augmentation. A final application domain of robotic technology is that of
human augmentation. Researchers have developed legged walking machines that can carry
people around, very much like a wheelchair. Several research efforts presently focus on the
