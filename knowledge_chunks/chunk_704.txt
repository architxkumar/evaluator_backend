i kazirhut. :motionalDrama(scenesFromAMarriage). SE Con 3-6 define different genres of films. Lines 7-12 give some examples of the different genres. Lines 3alaji likes all movies except emotional dramas. The way that works is as follows. If we make the que ?- likesMovie(balaji, bladeRunner). yes iswer will be yes. This is because Prolog first tries rule 1, in which the subgoal emotinalDrama(blade acktracks and tries rule 2, which eventually triggers the rule in line 5 that succeeds. we ask, ?- likesMovie(balaji, scenesFromAMarriage). no J will say no. This happens because the emotionalDrama sub-goal in rule 1 succeeds. The inferenc seeds to the next predicate cut, which succeeds by definition, and finally to the last one that returns f of the cut operator the inference abandons its search and reports fail which Prolog interprets as nc rve that the ordering of the clauses is critical. If the order of clauses 1 and 2 were to be changed ould have been different. Also note that an existential query Does there exist a movie that Balaji lil S an exercise the reader is encouraged to modify the clauses such that this query too is answered ci se of cut in the movie example changed the meaning of the clauses. The clauses now entail that Bz 1ovies that are emotional dramas. Such cuts are known as red cuts, as opposed to green cuts like tl ing plan example that are only their for efficiency. an use the cut-fail combination to define the negation of a predicate as failure to prove it. If the goal jing set of statements defines negation as failure. neg(G) :- G, , fail. neg(G). ; true then due to the first line fail (no) is returned, else true (yes) is returned. We can in fact write ot one line as follows, likesMovie(balaji, X) :- movie(X), neg(emotionalDrama(X)). says that Balaji likes all movies as long as they are not emotional dramas. tion as failure provides us a useful tool for defining compliments of sets. For example we can d compositeNumber(N) :- neg(primeNumber(N)). weak
