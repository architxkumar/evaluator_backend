CONFIGURATION iertoplanwithaconfigurationspacerepresentation. Insteadofrepresenting thestateofthe

robot by the Cartesian coordinates of its elements, we represent the state by a configuration
of the robot s joints. Our example robot possesses two joints. Hence, we can represent its
state with the two angles and for the shoulder joint and elbow joint, respectively. In

particular, whenplanning apath one could simply connect the present configuration and the
target configuration by a straight line. In following this path, the robot would then move its

Unfortunately,configurationspaceshavetheirownproblems. Thetaskofarobotisusu-
ally expressed in workspace coordinates, not in configuration space coordinates. This raises
the question of how tomapbetween workspace coordinates and configuration space. Trans-
forming configuration space coordinates into workspace coordinates is simple: it involves
a series of straightforward coordinate transformations. These transformations are linear for
