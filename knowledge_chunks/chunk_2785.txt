tences have manypossible interpretations, but usually only one is appropriate. Disam-
biguation relies on knowledge about the world, about the current situation, and about
languageuse. Machine translation systems have been implemented using a range of techniques,
from full syntactic and semantic analysis to statistical techniques based on phrase fre-
quencies. Currentlythestatistical modelsaremostpopularandmostsuccessful. Speech recognition systems are also primarily based on statistical principles. Speech
systemsarepopularanduseful, albeitimperfect. Together, machine translation and speech recognition are two of the big successes of
natural language technology. One reason that the models perform well is that large
corpora areavailable both translation and speech aretasks that areperformed inthe
wild by people every day. In contrast, tasks like parsing sentences have been less
successful, in part because no large corpora of parsed sentences are available in the
wild andinpartbecauseparsing isnotusefulinandofitself.
