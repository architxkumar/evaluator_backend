Turing, developed probabilistic representations and Bayesian inference methods that could
be regarded as a forerunner of modern Bayesian networks although the paper is not often

The influence diagram representation for decision problems, which incorporated a
DAG representation for random variables, was used in decision analysis in the late 1970s
(see Chapter 16), but only enumeration was used for evaluation. Judea Pearl developed the
message-passing methodforcarryingoutinferenceintreenetworks(Pearl,1982a)andpoly-
tree networks (Kim and Pearl, 1983) and explained the importance of causal rather than di-
agnostic probability models, incontrast tothecertainty-factor systemstheninvogue.
The first expert system using Bayesian networks was CONVINCE (Kim, 1983). Early
applicationsinmedicineincludedthe MUNI Nsystemfordiagnosingneuromusculardisorders
(Andersen etal.,1989) andthe PATHFINDER system forpathology (Heckerman, 1991). The
CPCS system (Pradhan et al., 1994) is a Bayesian network for internal medicine consisting
