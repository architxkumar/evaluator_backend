he sensors forms the antigen while the actions that it can take form part of the antibodies. The sensors detect the current state (antigen) in the form of a quadruple <Garbage_to_X, Obstacle_to_Y, Home_Base _Z, Energy_level_is_ E> where X, Y, Z and E could be read using any of the values given below X = Front OR Right OR Left OR None OR On_Gripper Y = Front OR Right OR Left OR None Z = Front OR Right OR Left OR Near OR Far OR Middle E = High OR Low The antibody, the condition and action together constitute the paratope as shown in Fig. 24.11. | Condition Paratope Idiotope ID, siz Fig. 24.11 An Antibody Molecule in the robot's world (24,1) Action Artificial Immune Systems 491 RIN CRATONTENERNERONNN INOS STINSECHON An antigen is detected by an antibody based on the current state. If the current state matches the Condition in the antibody, then the corresponding Action is performed. The idiotope is formed by a tuple - (IDnumber, 5;, )). The first parameter indicates the ID number of the antibody with which it interacts while the second forms its stimulation level. The presence of an antigen may trigger several antibodies, which means the current state could fit into Condition-Action paratopes of several antibodies. Under such conditions, one of them is randomly selected and the associated Action is performed. If the result of this action is a positive one then it is rewarded else it is penalized. A connection is formed between these antibodies and the stimulation level is governed by the reward or penalty. Figure 24.12 shows how two antibodies link together to fofm part of the network.
