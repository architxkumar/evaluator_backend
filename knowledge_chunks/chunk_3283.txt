 the conjunctions) are clauses and the set of such expression is said to be in clausal form. As an example of this process, let us convert the expression 3x Vy (Vz P(fx),y,z) -. (3u Q(x.u) & 3v R(y.v))) into clausal form. We have after application of step I Ix Vy fl Vz) P(f(x Ly,z) V t3u O(x,u) & (30 R(y,v)))). After application of step 2 we obtain Ix Vy tlz P(f(x),y.z) V (3u Q(x,u) & (Iv) R(y,v)). After application of step 4 (step 3 is not required) Vy (P(tta),y.g(y)) V (Q(a,h(y)) & R(y.l(y))). After application of step 5 the result is Vy t CP(f(a).y.gy V 0(a,h(y)) & (Ptf(o),y.g(y)) V R(y,I(y))). Finally, after application of step 6 we obtain the clausal form P(f(a),y.g(y)) V O(a,h(y)) P(f(a),y.g(y) V R(y.l(y)) The last two clauses of our final form are understood to be universally quantified in the variable y and to have the conjunction symbol connecting them. It should be noted that the set of clauses produced by the above process are not equivalent to the original expression, but satisfiability is retained. That is, the set of clauses are satisfiable if and only if the original sentence is satisfiable. Having now labored through the tedious steps above, we point out that it is often possible to write down Statements directly in clausal form without working through the above process step-by-step. We illustrate how this may be done in Section 4.7 when we create a sample knowledge base. Sec. 4.6 Inference Rules 65 4.6 INFERENCE RULES Like PL, a key inference rule in FOPL is modus ponens. From the assertion 'Leo is a lion" and the implication 'all lions are ferocious" we can conclude that Leo is ferocious. Written in symbolic form we have assertion: LION(leo) implication: Vx LION(x) -. FEROCIOUS(r) conclusion: FEROCIOVS(leo) In general, if a has property 1' and all objects that have property P also have property Q, we conclude that a has property Q. P( a) V.i P(x) -, Q(x) Q(a) Note that in concluding Q(a), a substitution of a for x was necessary. This was possible,
