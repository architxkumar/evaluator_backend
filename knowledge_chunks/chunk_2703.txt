From this excerpt we can start to get an idea of what might be good features to include in
the supervised learning model. Word n-grams such as forcheap and You can buy seem
to be indicators of spam (although they would have a nonzero probability in ham as well).
Character-level features also seem important: spam ismore likely tobe alluppercase and to
havepunctuationembeddedinwords. Apparentlythespammersthoughtthatthewordbigram you deserve would be too indicative of spam, and thus wrote yo,u d-eserve instead. A
character model should detect this. We could either create a full character n-gram model
of spam and ham, or we could handcraft features such as number of punctuation marks
embeddedinwords. Note that we have two complementary ways of talking about classification. In the
language-modeling approach, wedefineonen-gramlanguagemodelfor P(Message spam)
bytrainingonthespamfolder,andonemodelfor P(Message ham)bytrainingontheinbox.
Thenwecanclassify anewmessagewithanapplication of Bayes rule:
argmax P(c message) argmax P(message c)P(c).
c spam,ham c spam,ham where P(c)isestimated justby counting thetotal numberofspam and ham messages. This
approach workswellforspamdetection, justasitdidforlanguage identification.

In the machine-learning approach we represent the message as a set of feature value
pairs and apply a classification algorithm h to the feature vector X. We can make the
language-modeling andmachine-learning approachescompatiblebythinkingofthen-grams
as features. This is easi
