Of course, there were calculating devices before the electronic computer. The earliest
automated machines, dating from the 17th century, were discussed on page 6. The first pro-
grammable machine was a loom, devised in 1805 by Joseph Marie Jacquard (1752 1834),
that used punched cards to store instructions for the pattern to be woven. In the mid-19th
century, Charles Babbage (1792 1871) designed two machines, neither of which he com-
pleted. The Difference Enginewasintended tocomputemathematical tables forengineering
andscientificprojects. Itwasfinallybuiltandshowntoworkin1991atthe Science Museum

AI also owes a debt to the software side of computer science, which has supplied the

concepts ofsymbolic, functional, declarative, andobject-oriented programming.
