the convention stay on the right side of the road in most countries; the alternative, stay
on the left side, works equally well as long as all agents in an environment agree. Similar
considerations applytothedevelopmentofhumanlanguage, wheretheimportantthingisnot
which language each individual should speak, but the fact that a community all speaks the
samelanguage. Whenconventions arewidespread, theyarecalled sociallaws.
SOCIALLAWS
In the absence of a convention, agents can use communication to achieve common
knowledge of a feasible joint plan. For example, a tennis player could shout Mine! or Yours! toindicateapreferredjointplan. Wecovermechanismsforcommunicationinmore
depth in Chapter 22, where we observe that communication does not necessarily involve a
verbalexchange. Forexample,oneplayercancommunicateapreferredjointplantotheother
simply by executing the first part of it. If agent Aheads forthe net, then agent B is obliged
togobacktothebaselinetohittheball,becauseplan2istheonlyjointplanthatbeginswith
A s heading forthe net. This approach to coordination, sometimes called planrecognition,
