Finally, ASK(KB,OK6 ) true, so the square 2,2 is OK to move into. In fact, given a

Solving the representational and inferential frame problems is a big step forward, but

PROBLEM
There is no complete solution within logic; system designers have to use good judgment in
deciding how detailed they want to be in specifying their model, and what details they want
toleaveout. Wewillseein Chapter13thatprobability theoryallowsustosummarizeallthe
