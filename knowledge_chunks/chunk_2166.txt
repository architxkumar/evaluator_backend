13.10 Deciding to put probability theory to good use, we encounter a slot machine with
three independent wheels, each producing one of the four symbols BAR, BELL, LEMON, or
CHERRY withequal probability. Theslotmachinehasthefollowingpayout schemeforabet
of1coin(where ? denotes thatwedon tcarewhatcomesupforthatwheel):

BELL BELL BELL pays15coins
LEMON LEMON LEMON pays5coins

CHERRY CHERRY ? pays2coins
CHERRY ? ? pays1coin
a. Compute the expected payback percentage of the machine. In other words, foreach
coinplayed, whatistheexpected coinreturn?
b. Computetheprobability thatplaying theslotmachineonce willresultinawin.
c. Estimate the mean and median number of plays you can expect to make until you go
broke, ifyou start with10coins. Youcanrun asimulation toestimate this, ratherthan
