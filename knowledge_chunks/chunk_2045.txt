unambiguously. Note that communication can workas wellwith competitive agents aswith
cooperative ones.
Conventions can also arise through evolutionary processes. For example, seed-eating
harvester ants are social creatures that evolved from the less social wasps. Colonies of ants
execute very elaborate joint plans without any centralized control the queen s job is to re-
produce, not to do centralized planning and with very limited computation, communica-
tion,andmemorycapabilities ineachant(Gordon, 2000,2007). Thecolonyhasmanyroles,
including interior workers, patrollers, and foragers. Each ant chooses to perform a role ac-
cording tothe local conditions it observes. Forexample, foragers travel awayfrom the nest,

foragers return to the nest is an approximation of the availability of food today. When the

Onefinalexampleofcooperative multiagent behavior appears intheflocking behavior
of birds. We can obtain a reasonable simulation of a flock if each bird agent (sometimes
BOID called a boid) observes the positions of its nearest neighbors and then chooses the heading
