ding on the KL-ONE system (Schmolze and
Lipkis, 1983), several researchers developed systems that incorporate theoretical complex-
ity analysis, most notably KRYPTON (Brachman et al., 1983) and Classic (Borgida et al.,
1989). The result has been a marked increase in the speed of inference and a much better
understanding of the interaction between complexity and expressiveness in reasoning sys-
tems. Calvaneseetal.(1999)summarizethestateoftheart,and Baader etal.(2007)present
a comprehensive handbook of description logic. Against this trend, Doyle and Patil (1991)
have argued that restricting the expressiveness of a language either makes it impossible to
