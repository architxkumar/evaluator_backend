inhibited, and so a patient could have a cold, but not exhibit a fever. The model makes two
assumptions. First, it assumes that all the possible causes are listed. (If some are missing,
we can always add a so-called leak node that covers miscellaneous causes. ) Second, it

assumes that inhibition of each parent is independent of inhibition of any other parents: for

Flu from causing a fever. Given these assumptions, Fever is false if and only if all its true
parents are inhibited, and the probability of this is the product of the inhibition probabilities

In general, noisy logical relationships in which a variable depends on k parents can be de-
scribed using O(k) parameters instead of O(2k) for the full conditional probability table.
This makes assessment and learning much easier. For example, the CPCS network (Prad-
han etal., 1994) uses noisy-OR and noisy-MAX distributions tomodel relationships among
diseases and symptoms ininternal medicine. With 448
