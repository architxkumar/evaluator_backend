18.11.1 Casestudy: Handwrittendigitrecognition
Recognizing handwritten digits is an important problem with many applications, including
automated sorting of mail by postal code, automated reading of checks and tax returns, and
dataentryforhand-held computers. Itisanareawhererapid progresshasbeenmade,inpart
