Stuart would like to thank his parents for their support and encouragement and his
wife, Loy Sheflott, for her endless patience and boundless wisdom. He hopes that Gordon,
Lucy, George, and Isaac will soon be reading this book after they have forgiven him for
working so long on it. RUGS (Russell s Unusual Group of Students) have been unusually
helpful, asalways.
Peter would like to thank his parents (Torsten and Gerda) for getting him started,
and his wife (Kris), children (Bella and Juliet), colleagues, and friends for encouraging and
tolerating himthrough thelonghoursofwritingandlongerhoursofrewriting.
