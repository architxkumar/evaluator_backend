reater than x and y. Likewise (sk16 ?x) is some girl who x likes. While cor 5 we may use names of Skolem functions meaningful to us, like (greaterThanBoth ?x ?y) or (LikedBy ner a variable is universally quantified or existentially quantified has to be decided carefully. One m hat a negation sign influences the nature of the quantifier. Consider the formalization of An imm c exist which is another way of saying that all men are mortal. 3 x (Man(x) A Mortal(x)) is the nature of the variable x? On the surface it is bound by an existential quantifier so one might m e it as 7((Man sk11) A (Mortal sk11)) but that only talks of a specific, albeit unspecified, indi Is. The correct way to skolemize a formula is to first push the negation sign inside. That gives us the Y x7(Man(x) A Mortal(x)) X reveals its true form, being a universally quantified variable. The following somewhat disci illustrates the fact that the antecedent in an implication statement also has negation lurking insic reads If there exists a number that is even and odd then the Earth is flat and is formalized as, (3x (Number(x) A Even(x) A Odd(x))) Flat(Earth) ver if we rewntezinaufiosanlas as, (dx (Number(x) A Even(x) A Odd(x))) V Flat(Earth) Vx Vy ( Detective(x) V ASidekick(y, x) V Successft x) Vv Vx Vy ( (Detective(x) A Sidekick(y, x)) V"Successft Vx Vy (-(Detective(x) A Sidekick(y, x)) D Successfu unification algorithm the Skolem constants and function names are simply treated as constan this with a couple of examples. m 3 x Even(x) 1 Wx (Even(x) D 7Odd(x)) ir 3 x 7Odd(x) we skolemize the premises, we get, (Even SomeEvenNumber) ((Even ?x) D 7Odd(x)) the substitution ?x SomeEvenNumber we can infer Odd(SomeEvenNumber). The second exai lises, Everyone loves someone and If someone loves somebody then they care for them . The , t everyone cares for someone.
