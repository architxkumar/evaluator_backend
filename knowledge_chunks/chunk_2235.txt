The inclusion of continuous random variables in Bayesian networks was considered
by Pearl (1988) and Shachter and Kenley (1989); these papers discussed networks contain-
ing only continuous variables with linear Gaussian distributions. The inclusion of discrete
variables has been investigated by Lauritzen and Wermuth (1989) and implemented in the

probit distribution is usually attributed to Gaddum (1933) and Bliss (1934), although it had
been discovered several times in the 19th century. Bliss s work was expanded considerably
by Finney(1947). Theprobit hasbeenusedwidelyformodeling discrete choicephenomena
