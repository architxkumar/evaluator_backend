one by converting the knowledge base to propositional logic and using
propositional inference, which we already know how to do. The next section points out an
obviousshortcut, leadingtoinference methodsthatmanipulate first-ordersentences directly.
9.1.1 Inference rules forquantifiers
Let us begin with universal quantifiers. Suppose our knowledge base contains the standard
folkloric axiomstatingthatallgreedykingsareevil: x King(x) Greedy(x) Evil(x).

UNIVERSAL The rule of Universal Instantiation (UI for short) says that we can infer any sentence ob-

tained by substituting a ground term (a term without variables) for the variable.1 To write

Let SUBST( , )denote theresult ofapplying thesubstitution tothesentence . Thenthe
ruleiswritten v SUBST( v g , )
for any variable v and ground term g. For example, the three sentences given earlier are
obtained withthesubstitutions x John , x Richard ,and x Father(John) .
EXISTENTIAL In the rule for Existential Instantiation, the variable is replaced by a single new con-

toanotherobject. Mathematics provides anice example:
