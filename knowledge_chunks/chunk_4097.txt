There are four primitive conceptual categories from which dependency structures can be built. These are ACTs PPs AAs PAs Actions Objects (picture producers) Modifiers of actions (action aiders) Modifiers of PPs (picture aiders) In addition, dependency structures are themselves conceptualizations and can serve as components of larger dependency structures. Strong Slot-and-Filler Structures A 209 The dependencies among conceptualizations correspond to semantic relations among the underlying (concepts. Figure 10.2 lists the most important ones allowed by CD.! The first column contains the rules; the second contains examples of their-use Land the third contains an English version of each example.
