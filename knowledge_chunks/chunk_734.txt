In the next section we look at an endeavour to link many such data resources into a large graph database freely accessible over the world wide web. 13.3.2 The Linked Open Data Cloud The LOD (Linking Open Data) project? is espoused by the erstwhile SWEO (Semantic Web Education and Outreach) Interest Group of the W3C consortium. The goal of the project is to make data freely available to everyone on the web. The LOD cloud refers to a network of servers that host data in the form of RDF triples from various domains. Thus the LOD cloud can be seen as a massive graph database on the web. The goal is to make the various data sets available on the web in a well defined format under the Creative Commons license , and move from a web of documents towards the web of data also referred to as the Semantic Web or Web 3.0. It would then be possible for programs to search for data over the web and use the results for further processing directly. The different data sources are also connected by RDF links to enable programs to navigate between related data sets. Development of Linked Data browsers and Linked Data search engines facilitate the retrieval process (Bizer et al, 2009). Thus a program has access to the entire data from the different sources and can use it to compute answers to queries. Tim Berners-Lee prescribed the following Linked Data principles for people publishing data on the web (Berners-Le
