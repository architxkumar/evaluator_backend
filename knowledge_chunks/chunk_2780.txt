 Fourier transform is used to determine the amount of acoustic energy at
about a dozen frequencies. Then we compute a measure called the mel frequency cepstral
MELFREQUENCY
CEPSTRAL coefficient (MFCC) or MFCC for each frequency. We also compute the total energy in
COEFFICIENT(MFCC)
the frame. That gives thirteen features; for each one we compute the difference between
this frame and the previous frame, and the difference between differences, for a total of 39
features. These arecontinuous-valued; theeasiest waytofitthem intothe HM Mframework

We have seen how to go from the raw acoustic signal to a series of observations, e .

Now we have to describe the (unobservable) states of the HMM and define the transition
model, P(X t X t 1 ), and the sensor model, P(E t X t ). The transition model can be broken
into two levels: word and phone. We ll start from the bottom: the phone model describes
