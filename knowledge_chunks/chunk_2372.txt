Submodularity captures the intuitive notion of diminishing returns. Is the value of in-

of decisions. Sequential decision problems incorporate utilities, uncertainty, and sensing,
and include search and planning problems as special cases. Section 17.1 explains how se-
quential decision problems are defined, and Sections 17.2 and 17.3 explain how they can
be solved to produce optimal behavior that balances the risks and rewards of acting in an
uncertain environment. Section 17.4 extends these ideas to the cas
