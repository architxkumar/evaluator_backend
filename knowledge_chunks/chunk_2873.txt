25.3.2 Othertypes ofperception
Not all of robot perception is about localization or mapping. Robots also perceive the tem-
perature, odors, acoustic signals, andsoon. Manyofthese quantities canbeestimated using
variants of dynamic Bayes networks. Allthat is required for such estimators are conditional
probability distributions that characterize the evolution ofstate variables overtime, andsen-
sormodelsthatdescribe therelationofmeasurementstostatevariables.
It is also possible to program a robot as a reactive agent, without explicitly reasoning
aboutprobability distributions overstates. Wecoverthat approach in Section25.6.3.
The trend in robotics is clearly towards representations with well-defined semantics.
