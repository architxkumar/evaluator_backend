 to have probability 1, and the optimistic value, considered to have probability 0, of that node. If the former is 20 and the latter 250, then the probability of a target value of 100 is given by, Prob(100) (250 100) (250 20) 0.652 The probability of the best node is backed up for a MAX node, while for a MIN node, the product of the probabilities of the children is backed up. Figure 8.35 by Berliner shows a sample tree to illustrate these values. First, the root node is expanded to generate three children: A, B and C. The three are evaluated using the probe search, and their real values are 20, 18 and 10 respectively. The target value by the formula given above is (40 20) 2 30. Assuming that the probability of achieving real value is 1, the optimistic value 0, the probabilities of A, B, and C of achieving the target of 30 are interpolated as 0.875, 0.445, and 0.000 respectively. Note that the third one is set to zero. A ai i Tig KN SBN 7A 0.875 (0.445 ( 0.000 Qo Kass ao FIGURE 8.35 A sample tree generated by B . The nodes are arranged left to right in order of goodness for the respective player. The solid lines represent node chosen by B for exploration. Figure from (Berliner, 1979). The following table shows the complete values for the nodes in the above tree. The most promising node A is expanded to generate nodes E, F and G. This is because A has the highest probability of achieving the target 30. The optimistic and pessimistic values are inherited from the parent, switching their labels. The real values are computed by a probe search. The probabilities of the three achieving the target 30 are 0.875, 1.000 and 1.000 respectively (since the latter two are better than the target). The product of these three, viz. 0.875, is backed up to the parent A, because node A is like an AND node.
