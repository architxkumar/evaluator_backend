construct thefollowingpayoffmatrix:
Alice:testify Alice:refuse
Bob:testify A 5,B 5 A 10,B 0
Bob:refuse A 0,B 10 A 1,B 1
Alice analyzes the payoff matrix as follows: Suppose Bob testifies. Then I get 5 years if I
testify and 10 years if I don t, so in that case testifying is better. On the other hand, if Bob
refuses, then Iget0yearsif Itestifyand1yearif Irefuse,sointhatcaseaswelltestifying is

If Alice is clever as well as rational, she will continue to reason as follows: Bob s

When each player has a dominant strategy, the combination of those strategies is called a
