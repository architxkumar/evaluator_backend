gnments do not change across successive iterations. Cluster centroids do not change across successive iterations. Note that both these criteria are equivalent. Iteration 1 E-step: Calculate the distance between each point to the cluster centroids, using Euclidean distance formula. The distances are shown in Table 18.6.

M-step: Re-estimate centroids of the two clusters. The genes 1 to 5 are assigned to cluster 1, while genes 6 to 10 are assigned to cluster 2. Based on this assignment, we re-estimate cluster centroids. The new centroids are as follows: by (1.8, 1.6) and pp (4.8, 4.8) Next, we check the convergence criteria as mentioned before in Line 2 of the algorithm. Since there is a change in cluster assignment, we conclude the iterative procedure is not converged and hence we continue with the iterations. Iteration 2 E-step: Calculate the distance between each point to the cluster centroids, using the Euclidean distance formula (Table 18.8). It can be seen that the assignments of genes to clusters remains the same here. M-step: Re-estimate centroids of each of the K clusters. When we recomputed the centroids of the two clusters, we found that the centroids do not change as well. My (1.8, 1.6) and po (4.8, 4.8) Since the cluster labels of each object (gene) remains unchanged, as does the centroid for each cluster, the iterative procedure has converged. Genes 1 to 5 form one cluster with centroid y, (1.8, 1.6) and genes 6 10 for the second cluster with centroid pp (4.8
