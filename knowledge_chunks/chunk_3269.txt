The proof of theorem 4.2 follows directly from theorem 41 since a is a Sec. 4.2 Syntax and Semantics for Propositional Logic 53 TABLE 4.2 SOME EQUIVALENCE LAWS Idempotency pv P P P&P .

When s is a logical consequence of the set S {s......s,,} we will also say S logically implies or logically entails s, written SI-s. It is often convenient to make substitutions when considering compound statements. If s1 is equivalent to s, st may be substituted for s without changing the truth value of a statement or set of sentences containing S2. Table 4.2 lists some of the important laws of PL. Note that the equal sign as used in the table has the same meaning as : it also denotes equivalence. One way to determine the equivalence of two sentences is by using truth tables. For example, to show that P - Q is equivalent to P V Q and that P . Q is equivalent to the expression (P . Q) & (Q P), a truth table such as Table 4.3, can be constructed to verify or disprove the equivalences. TABLE 4.3 TRUTH TABLE FOR EQUIVALENT SENTENCES P Q P (P V Q P .. Q) (Q -.
