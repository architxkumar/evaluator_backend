mes in, the mass distribution is m,( Aditi, Urvi ) 0.6 and m 4( ) 0.4. This corresponds to Bel( Aditi, Urvi ) 0.6, Bel(Q) 1.0, and for every set S such that Aditi, Urvi SS, Bel(S ) 0.6. The rest have zero belief. mx(A) a m m,(A) Lyaye4 m X) mY) When there are more than one pieces of evidence, one can use the Dempster s rule to combine the evidences. Let mj and m, be two mass functions. Then the combined mass function m m m,, given by Dempster s rule, is as follows. That is, after combining the two sets of evidences with belief mass m; and my, the updated mass for any set A is the sum of the products of m(X) and m,(Y) for all pairs X and Y such that XNY A. In the simple case (as in our example) when there is only one such pair, the summation is not needed, and is The four sets which have the evidence to be combined are Aditi, Urvi and for mz, and Amala, Urvi and for mz. The table below contains all no empty intersections for which the Dempster s rule results in nonzero mass.

For any set A, the belief Bel(A) is the sum of beliefs of all its subsets. Observe that Bel( Aditi, Urvi ) is still 0.6 and Bel( Amala, Urvi ) is 0.8. The Dempster-Shafer theory defines the amount of belief in any set A as an interval defined by two values. One, Bel(A) is the minimum belief one has in the set. The other P(A), or plausibility of A, defines the maximum possible belief in the set A. The resulting interval Bel(A), P(A) is defined as the confidence interval. For a
