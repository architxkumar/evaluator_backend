Next, we need a sensor model. We will consider two kinds of sensor model. The
first assumes that the sensors detect stable, recognizable features of the environment called
landmarks. Foreachlandmark,therangeandbearingarereported. Supposetherobot sstate

A somewhat different sensor model is used for an array of range sensors, each of which
has a fixed bearing relative to the robot. Such sensors produce a vector of range values

Figure 25.8(b) shows an example of a four-beam range scan and two possible robot poses,
oneofwhichisreasonablylikelytohaveproducedtheobservedscanandoneofwhichisnot.
Comparing the range-scan model to the landmark model, we see that the range-scan model
has the advantage that there is no need to identify a landmark before the range scan can be
interpreted; indeed, in Figure 25.8(b), the robot faces a featureless wall. On the other hand,
