 belief interval, IBel(A),P1(A)), is also sometimes referred to as the confidence in A, while the quantity P1(A) - Bel(A) is referred to as the uncertainty in A. It can be shown that (Prade 1983) P1(0) = 0. P1(U) = For all A P1(A) ^ Hel(A), Bel(A) + Be IIA) I. P1(A) + PICA) I, and For A B. Bel(A) Bel(B), P1(A) :5 P1(B) In interpreting the above definitions, it should be noted that a portion of belief may be committed to a 3et of propositions, but need not be, and if committed, it is not necessary to commit any belief to its negation. However, a belief committed to a proposition is committed to any other proposition it implies. A few specific interval belief values will help to clarify the intended semantics. For example, 10.11 represents no belief in support of the proposition [0,01 represents the belief the proposition is false 11.11 represents the belief the proposition is true 1.3,11 represents partial belief in the proposition 10_81 represents partial disbelief in the proposition 1.2,.71 represents belief from evidence both for and against the proposition 118 Probabilistic Reasoning Chap. 6 When evidence is available from two or more independent knowledge sources Bell and Be12, one would like to pool the evidence to reduce the uncertainty. For this, Dempster has provided such a combining function denoted as Bcl1o Bel2. ft Given two basic probability assignment functions, m1 and 2 corresponding to the belief functions Bell and Be121 let A1,..., Ak be the focal elements for Bell and B1, . . . , B be the focal elements for Bel2. Then m1(A) and m2(B,) each assign probability masses on the unit interval. They can be orthogonally combined as depicted with the square illustrated in Figure 6.2 (Garvey et al.. 1981). The unit square in Figure 6.2 represents the total probability mass assigned by both m1 and m2 for all of their common subsets. A particular subrectangle within the square, shown as the intersection of the sets Ai and B,, has committed to it the measure m1(A
