.,ical objects such as volume, density, weight, lighter-than, fragile, and so on. The operational criteria in this case requires that the concept definition be expressed in terms of the predicates used to describe the example. The objective of the learning process here is to develop a generalization of the training example that is a sufficient concept definition for the goal concept which satisfies the operationality criteria. These definitions are summarized in Figure 20.5. In carrying out the EBL method, the system must first construct an explanation of how the training example satisfies the goal concept. This requires that it select those attributes and relations which are relevant and which satisfy the operational criteria. From the goal concept definition it is seen that it is safe-to-stack an object if and only if either y is not fragile or x is lighter than s. A x on an object y search through the domain theory for the predicate FRAGILE fails; therefore, a search is then made for the predicate LIGHTER. This predicate is found in the rule WEl GHT(p,.V) & WEIGHT(P2.W2) & LESS(w,.W2) UGHER(p,.p2) (to Pi in the above rule) and obj2 toy (to P2 in the above rule) Matching objl to x we can form the following partial explanation for safe-to-stack.
