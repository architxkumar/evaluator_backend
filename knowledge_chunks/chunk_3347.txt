lity mass assigned by both m1 and m2 for all of their common subsets. A particular subrectangle within the square, shown as the intersection of the sets Ai and B,, has committed to it the measure m1(A1)m2(B). Likewise, any subset C of U may have one, or more than one, of these rectangles committed to it. Therefore, the total probability mass committed to C will be m(A1)m2(81) (6,9) A,fl D,C where the summation is over all i and j. The sum in' equation 6.9 must be normalized to account for the fact that some intersections A. fl B, = 0 will have positive probability which must be discarded. The final form of Dempster's rule of combination is then given by m10m2 (6.10) = rn1(A,)m2(B,) where the summations are taken over all i and I. As an example of the above concepts, recall once again the problem of identifying the terrorist group or groups responsible for a certain attack in some country. Suppose any of four known terrorist organizations A. B. C, and D could have been responsible for the attack. The possible subsets of U in this case form a lattice of sixteen subsets (Figure 6.3). Assume one piece of evidence supports the belief that groups A and C were m218,) Figure 6.2 Composition of probability mass from sources Be11 and Be).. 119 Sec. 6.5 Ad Hoc Methods / N A. 8. C.
