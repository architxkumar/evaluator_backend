change radically over the course of a few weeks, and some animals seem to have multiple
maps. Moreover, we do not fully understand how other areas can take over functions when

The measurement of intact brain activity began in 1929 with the invention by Hans
Bergerofthe electroencephalograph (EEG).Therecent development offunctional magnetic
resonance imaging (f MRI) (Ogawa et al., 1990; Cabeza and Nyberg, 2001) is giving neu-
roscientists unprecedentedly detailed images of brain activity, enabling measurements that
correspond in interesting ways to ongoing cognitive processes. These are augmented by
advances in single-cell recording of neuron activity. Individual neurons can be stimulated
electrically, chemically, orevenoptically(Hanand Boyden,2007),allowingneuronal input output relationships to be mapped. Despite these advances, we are still a long way from
understanding howcognitiveprocesses actually work.
The truly amazing conclusion is that a collection of simple cells can lead to thought,
action, and consciousness or, in the pithy words of John Searle (1992), brains cause minds.
