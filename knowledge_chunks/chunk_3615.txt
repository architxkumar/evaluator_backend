When a given symptom is present, the corresponding variable is given a value 346 Expert Systems Architectures Chap. 15 gr Swollen Red Hair Dizziness Sensitive Placibin feet ears loss aretha allergy Li, U] U4 15 U5 Figure 15.14) A irnsp!e neural network eper1 systern Frrsru S L (ii ILsnl ACM Communications.

Input symptom values are multiplied h their corresponding weights R',. Numbers within the nodes are initial bias weights o ,_ and numbers on the links are the other node input weights. When the sum of the weighted products of the inputs exceeds 0. an output will be present on the corresponding node output and serve as an input to the next layer of nodes. As an example. suppose the patient has swollen feet (u + I) but not red ears (u, = - I) nor hair loss (u3 = - l. This gives a value of u7 = + I (since O+2( l)+(-2)(-- l)+(3)( I) = I). suggesting the patient has superciliosis. When it is also known that the other symptoms of the patient are false (o = a6 = - I), it may be concluded that namatosis is absent (a5 = - I), and therefore that birambio (u10 = +1) should be prescribed while placibin should not be prescribed (u9 = - I). In addition, it will be found that posiboost should also be prescribed (U11 = +1). The intermediate triangular shaped nodes were added by the training algorithm. These additional nodes are needed so that weight assignments can be made which permit the computations to work correctly for all training instances. Sec. 15.5 Knowledge Acquisition and Validation 347 Deductions can be made just as well when only partial information is available. For example, when a patient has swollen feet and suffers from hair loss, it may be concluded the patient has superciliosis, regardless of whether or not the patient has red ears. This is so because the unknown variable cannot force the
