186 Chapter 5. Adversarial Search
RYBKA, winnerof the 2008 and 2009 World Computer Chess Championships, iscon-
sidered the strongest current computer player. It uses an off-the-shelf 8-core 3.2 GHz Intel
Xeon processor, but little is known about the design of the program. RYBKA s main ad-
vantage appears to be its evaluation function, which has been tuned by its main developer,
International Master Vasik Rajlich,andatleastthreeothergrandmasters.
The most recent matches suggest that the top computer chess programs have pulled

Othello, also called Reversi, is probably more popular as a computer game than as a board

deep search an expensive luxury. Most work on backgammon has gone into improving the
evaluation function. Gerry Tesauro (1992) combined reinforcement learning with neural
networks to develop a remarkably accurate evaluator that is used with a search to depth 2
or 3. After playing more than a million training games against itself, Tesauro s program,
