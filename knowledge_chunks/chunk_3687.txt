Therefore, the gain for color is G = Hr - Hrotor 0.955 - 0.594 = 0.361 The other gain values for horned, weight, and height are computed in a similar manner. 19.3 THE LEX SYSTEM LEX was developed during the early 1980s .:Mitchell et al., 1983) to learn heuristic rules for the solution of symbolic integration problems. The system is given about 40 integration operators which are expressed in the form of rewrite rules. Some of the rules are shown in Figure 19.3a. Internal representations for some typical integral expressions are given in Figure 19.3b: Each of the operators has preconditions which must be satisfied before it can be applied. For example, before 0P6 can be applied, the general form of the integrand must be the product of two real functions, that is udv = f1(x) * f,(x)dx. Each operator also has associated with it the resultant states that can be produced by that operator. For example, 0P6 can have 406 Examples of Other Inductive Learners Chap. 19 01,1 1 (lx)-. f(x) (fix) is any real function of xi ON Jr fix) -. r fox) ax Iris any real number) 01`3 Jsin(x)dx-. -cos(x)dx ON Jcos(x)
