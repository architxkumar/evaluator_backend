States, searching less than 0.1 of the graph. Others approaches to bidirectional search
include a breadth-first search backward from the goal up to a fixed depth, followed by a forward IDA search(Dillenburg and Nelson,1994;Manzini,1995). A andotherstate-space searchalgorithms areclosely relatedtothebranch-and-bound
techniques that are widely used in operations research (Lawler and Wood, 1966). The
relationships between state-space search and branch-and-bound have been investigated in
depth (Kumarand Kanal, 1983; Nauet al., 1984; Kumaret al., 1988). Martelli and Monta-
nari (1978) demonstrate a connection between dynamic programming (see Chapter 17) and

RBFS (Korf, 1993) is actually somewhat more complicated than the algorithm shown
in Figure 3.26, which is closer to anindependently developed algorithm called iterative ex-
