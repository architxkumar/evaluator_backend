us of the overloading. The CD theory, which has been used to describe every day actions, uses a small set of state variables, and a small set of conceptual acts. The state variables take numerical values, and similar language words or phrases map to different values of the variables. Some of the variables are described below. We have taken some illustrative mappings of words from the English language. One can extend the system to define mapping words from other languages as well. It would then serve as a common representation of meaning for different languages. health The value of this variable varies from -10 to 10. The different English words that could be mapped to it are, with their values, dead (-10), gravely ill (-9), sick (-9 to -1), under the weather (-2), all right (0), tip top (7), and perfect health (10). A person falling ill could be modeled as going from a state of say health 4 to say health -3. anger take values -10 to 0. Some examples are, furious (-9), enraged (-8), angry (-5), irked (-3), upset (-2) and calm (0). joy goes from -10 to 10. Examples, catatonic (-9), depressed (-5), upset (-3), sad (-2), OK (0), pleased (2), happy (5), ecstatic (10). fear goes from -10 to 0. For example, terrified (-9), scared (-5), anxious (-2), calm (0). hunger goes from -10 to 10. Examples: starving (-8), ravenous (-6), could eat a horse (-5), hungry (-3), no appetite (0), satisfied (3), full (5), stuffed (8), and satiated (3 to 10) disgust goes from -10 to 0. Example words that are mapped on to it, nauseated (-8), revolted(-7), disgusted (-6) and bothered (-2). surprise goes from 0 to 10. Examples: surprised (5), amazed (7), astounded (9). consciousness goes from 0 to 10. Examples: unconscious (0), asleep (5), awake (10), higher drug consciousness ( 10). Some states may be expressed as conjunctions of the primitive states, for example shocked surprise (6) A disgust (-5). These are states of human beings. Likewise other entities could have states too.
