It has been suggested that an alternate formula for computing be used in which one could normalize away the inconsistency. In the revised formula, one does not count the belief assigned to the empty hypothesis, but instead divides the beliefs obtained by a normalizing factor that is proportional to the degree of inconsistency. This could result in some counter-intuitive results that mask the inconsistency though (see Exercise 22). The revised Dempster s rule is as follows, mA) mjBm 6A) Vx Lxnvad and asd (X) mY) where K is the total belief in , K 2 yny- m(X) m,(Y) The reader is encouraged to apply the revised formula to the example above. 17.8 Discussion In this chapter we have discussed some techniques that have been proposed to deal with uncertainty. In the real world, any agent is faced with uncertainty and has to deal with in some way. The various approaches discussed here involve default reasoning, assumption based reasoning, qualitative reasoning, abduction and probabilistic approaches to characterize uncertainty. Every approach requires its own representation and reasoning schemes. Human beings deal with uncertainty in a variety of ways. Apart from first principles mechanisms to reason with u
