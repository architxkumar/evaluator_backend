When WALKSAT returns a model, the input sentence is indeed satisfiable, but when
it returns failure, there are two possible causes: either the sentence is unsatisfiable or we
need togive the algorithm more time. If weset max flips and p 0, WALKSAT will
eventually return a model (if one exists), because the random-walk steps will eventually hit

Forthisreason, WALKSAT ismostuseful whenweexpect asolution toexist forex-

WALKSAT cannot always detect unsatisfiability, which is required for deciding entailment.
