The resurgence of interest in state-space planning was pioneered by Drew Mc Der-
mott s UNPO Pprogram(1996),whichwasthefirsttosuggesttheignore-delete-listheuristic,
The name UNPOP was a reaction to the overwhelming concentration on partial-order plan-
ning at the time; Mc Dermott suspected that other approaches were not getting the attention
they deserved. Bonet and Geffner s Heuristic Search Planner (HSP) and its later deriva-
tives (Bonet and Geffner, 1999; Haslum et al., 2005; Haslum, 2006) were the first to make

state-space search practical for large planning problems. HSP searches in the forward di-
rection while HSPR (Bonet and Geffner, 1999) searches backward. The most successful
state-space searcher todate is FF (Hoffmann, 2001; Hoffmann and Nebel, 2001; Hoffmann,
2005), winner of the AIPS 2000 planning competition. FASTDOWNWARD (Helmert, 2006)
is a forward state-space search planner that preprocesses the action schemas into an alter-
