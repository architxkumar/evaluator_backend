Toillustrate these equations at work, we have applied them to the problem of tracking
anobject moving on the X Y plane. Thestate variables are X (X,Y,X ,Y ) (cid:12) , so F, ,

H, and are 4 4 matrices. Figure 15.11(a) shows the true trajectory, a series of noisy
z
observations, and the trajectory estimated by Kalman filtering, along with the covariances
indicated by the one-standard-deviation contours. The filtering process does a good job of
tracking theactualmotion,and,asexpected, thevariancequicklyreaches afixedpoint.
We can also derive equations for smoothing as well as filtering with linear Gaussian
models. Thesmoothing resultsareshownin Figure15.11(b). Noticehowthevariance inthe
position estimate issharply reduced, except attheends ofthetrajectory (why?),and thatthe
estimatedtrajectory ismuchsmoother.
15.4.4 Applicabilityof Kalmanfiltering
The Kalmanfilteranditselaborationsareusedinavastarrayofapplications. The classical application isinradartracking ofaircraftandmissiles. Relatedapplications includeacoustic
tracking of submarines and ground vehicles and visual tracking of vehicles and people. In a
slightly more esoteric vein, Kalman filters are used to reconstruct particle trajectories from
bubble-chamber photographs and ocean currents from satellite surface measurements. The
rangeofapplicationismuchlargerthanjustthetrackingofmotion: anysystemcharacterized
by continuous state variables and noisy measurements will do. Such systems include pulp
mills,chemicalplants, nuclearreactors, plantecosystems, andnational economies.
