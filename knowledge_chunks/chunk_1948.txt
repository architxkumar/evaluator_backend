A set of ground (variable-free) actions can be represented by a single action schema.
ACTIONSCHEMA
Theschemaisaliftedrepresentation it liftsthelevelofreasoning frompropositional logic
to a restricted subset of first-order logic. For example, here is an action schema for flying a
planefromonelocation toanother:
Action(Fly(p,from,to),
PRECOND:At(p,from) Plane(p) Airport(from) Airport(to)
EFFECT: At(p,from) At(p,to))
The schema consists of the action name, a list of all the variables used in the schema, a
precondition and an effect. Although we haven t said yet how the action schema converts
PRECONDITION
into logical sentences, think of the variables as being universally quantified. We are free to
EFFECT
choosewhatevervalueswewanttoinstantiatethevariables. Forexample,hereisoneground
