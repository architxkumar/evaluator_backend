Section 12.5 discusses reasoning systems designed for efficient inference with categories,
and Section 12.6 discusses reasoning with default information. Section 12.7 brings all the

12.1 ONTOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
In toy domains,thechoiceofrepresentation isnotthatimportant;manychoiceswillwork.
Complex domains such as shopping on the Internet or driving a car in traffic require more
general andflexiblerepresentations. Thischaptershowshowtocreatethese representations,
concentrating on general concepts such as Events, Time, Physical Objects, and Beliefs that occur in many different domains. Representing these abstract concepts is sometimes
ONTOLOGICAL calledontological engineering.
ENGINEERING
Theprospect of representing everything in the world is daunting. Ofcourse, wewon t
actually write a complete description of everything that would be far too much for even a
1000-page textbook but we will leave placeholders where new knowledge for any domain
canfitin. Forexample,wewilldefinewhatitmeanstobeaphysicalobject,andthedetailsof
