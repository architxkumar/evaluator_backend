atement. Observe that Urvi is the only singleton set (which satisfies the mutual exclusion property) that has positive belief. Now consider the third piece of evidence that comes in the points to the set Amala, Kopal , with belief mass 0.5. In the logic framework if one were to treat it as a true statement and add (Cartoonist(Amala) Cartoonist(Kopal)) to the set of statements, it would result in a contradiction. The D-S theory updates the belief mass distribution as follows. Table 17.16 The Dempster combination rule after the third piece of evidence M123 M420mg3 m4o( Urvi ) 0.48 1M493( ) 0.24 my2( Aditi, Urvi ) 0.12 m 423() 0.06 m42( Amala, Urvi ) M423( Amala, Urvi ) m3() 0.08 M423( Urvi ) 0.24 423( Aditi, Urvi ) 0.06 m3( Amala, Kopal ) 0.5 0.32 Myo3( Amala ) 0.16 0.16 mip( ) 0.08 mras((Amala, Kopal ) 7. .4() 0.04 The first thing to observe is that the empty set signifying inconsistency has acquired a nonzero mass (0.24 0.06 0.30). This inconsistency, as we have seen above, is due to the (somewhat unprincipled and) inconsistent allegations made against different sets of students. The resulting mass distribution is depicted in Figure 17.42. 0.04 Aditi, Urvi Aditi 0.3 Figure 17.42 The final belief mass distribution after the three statements have been combined. Observe that with the third piece of evidence, some mass has gone to the empty set which signify a degree of inconsistency. Let us compute the confidence intervals for the resulting sets, Bel( Urvi ) 113( Urvi ) my23( ) 0.24 0.3 0.54 P( Urvi ) 1 - Bel( Aditi, Amala, Kopal ) 1 (m23( Amala ) m,93( Amala, Kopal ) 7 )3;( )) 1-(0.16 0.04 0.30) 1 - 0.50 0.50 The confidence interval for Urvi has now become 0.54, 0.5 , which signals inconsistency. The remaining confidence intervals are, Bel( Amala ) m,33( Amala ) 11)( ) 0.16 0.3 0.46 P( Amala ) 1 - Bel( Aditi, Kopal, Urvi ) 1 (rm 33( Urvi ) mm 33( (Aditi, Urvi ) mn 33( )) 1-(0.24 0.06 0.30) 1 -0.60 0.40 Bel( Aditi, Urvi ) my93( Aditi, Urvi ) m23( Urvi ) m23( ) 0.06 0.2
