theparticularnumericalvalues, butthefactthatmeasures canbeordered.
Although measures are not numbers, we can still compare them, using an ordering
symbol such as . For example, we might well believe that Norvig s exercises are tougher

The real world can be seen as consisting of primitive objects (e.g., atomic particles) and
composite objects built from them. Byreasoning at the level of large objects such as apples
