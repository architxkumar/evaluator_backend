 too could be defined by any of the latter variables. The output of the system, which is the flow-rate of the water controlled by the motorized pump, could also be defined accordingly by yet another set of fuzzy terms -Strong-Negative (SN), Negative (N), Low-Negative (LN), Medium (M), Low-Positive (LP), Positive (P) and High-Positive (HP). Fuzzy Logic Systems 449 Fuzzy profiles With real data available we now define profiles for each of these parameters (viz. temperature, fan motor speed and flow rate) by assigning memberships to their respective values. The graphs shown in Fig. 22.2 depict this relationship for the inputs temperature and fan speed while Fig. 22.3 reveals this for the output flow rate. Observe that the regions for each of the sets for both the input parameters, temperature and fan motor speed, as also the output have a common intersection area. For example, we may say that when the temperature is 25 degrees, its membership to the fuzzy set moderate is 1 (100%), But as we drift away to 30 degrees, its membership to this set decreases while the same to the set arm starts to increase. Thus when the temperature is 30 degrees it is neither fully moderate nor warm. These profiles have to be carefully designed after studying the nature and desired behaviour of the system. 1.2 1.2 2 F |Cold Cool Moderate Warm Hot 2 Slack Low Medium Brisk Fast 5 5 B 084 2 o D o D = 0675 = 3 J 36 8 04 g B 02+ 8 a a 4 0 4 4 7 101316 1922 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 1 4 7 101316 1922 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 Temperature Motor Speed RPM (a) Temperature {b) Fan Motor Speed Fig. 22.2 42 2 SN N LN M LP P HP 6 1 FE \ 08 o O = 06 36 a 0.4 g B 02 a 0 T T T T T T T 1 O02 04 06 08 1 #12 14 16 Flow Rate (mi/sec} Fig. 22.3 Water Flow Rate Fuzzy Rules The fuzzy rules form the triggers of the fuzzy engine. After a study of the system we could write linguistic tules (so akin to natural language) such as RI: R2: R3: R4: RS: R6: R7: R8: If temperature is HOT and fan motor speed is SLACK then
