ded the bus will also be at point B. The Drive operator could be represented as (Koehler et al., 1997), Action name: DriveBus Parameters: Bus (type bus); A, B (type Location); X (type Object) Preconditions: At(Bus, A) Effects: Del(At(Bus, A)), Add(At(Bus, B)), Va(In(x, Bus) D (Del(At(x, A)), Add(At(x, B))) The above action could be represented in PDDL as, (action driveBus iparameters (?bus -bus ?from ?to - location) :precondition (at ?bus ?from) reffect (and (not (at ?bus ?from)) (at ?bus ?to) (forall (2x - object) (when (in ? x ?bus) (and (not (at ? x ?from)) (at ? x ?to))))) It has been observed that an action with conditional effects can be viewed as a set of actions with different preconditions. To see this, let us first translate the above operator into a quantifier free one for a domain in which there are only two persons who could be in the school bus, Aditi and Jeena. The operator would then look like, (:action driveBus :parameters (?bus -bus ?from ?to - location) tprecondition (at ?bus ?from) seffect (and (not (at ?bus ?from)) (at ?bus ?to) (when (in aditi ?bus) (and (not (at aditi ?from)) (at aditi ?to))) (when (in jeena ?bus) (and (not (at jeena ?from)) (at jeena ?to))))) Now this action with conditional effects can be translated into four STRIPS actions, called aspects in (Gazen and Knoblock, 1997). The four actions aspects are, raction driveBusl iparameters (?hus -bus ?from ?to - location) iprecondition (at ?bus ?from) reffect (and (not (at ?bus ?from)) (at ?bus ?to))) (:action driveBus2 iparameters (?hus -bus ?from ?to - location) rprecondition (and (at ?bus ?from) (in aditi ?bus)) reffect (and (not (at ?bus ?from)) (at 2bus ?to) (not (at aditi ?from)) (at aditi ?to)))) (:action driveBus3 parameters (?hus -bus ?from ?to - location) tprecondition (and (at ?bus ?from) (in jeena ?bus)) reffect (and (not (at ?bus ?from)) (at ?bus ?to) (not (at jeena ?from)) (at jeena ?to)))) (:action driveBus4 iparameters (?hus -bus ?from ?to - location) precondition (and
