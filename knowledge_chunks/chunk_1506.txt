PROBLEM-SOLVING This chapter describes one kind of goal-based agent called a problem-solving agent.
AGENT
Problem-solving agents use atomic representations, as described in Section 2.4.7 that is,
statesoftheworldareconsideredaswholes,withnointernalstructurevisibletotheproblem-
solving algorithms. Goal-based agents that use more advanced factored or structured rep-
resentations areusuallycalled planningagentsandarediscussed in Chapters7and10.
Ourdiscussionofproblemsolvingbeginswithprecisedefinitionsofproblemsandtheir
solutions and give several examples to illustrate these definitions. We then describe several
general-purpose search algorithms that can be used to solve these problems. We will see
several uninformed search algorithms algorithms that are given no information about the
problem otherthan itsdefinition. Although some ofthese algorithms can solve anysolvable
problem, noneofthemcandosoefficiently. Informedsearchalgorithms, ontheotherhand,
