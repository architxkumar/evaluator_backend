the possibilities. Because the hypothesis space is usually vast (oreveninfinite inthe case of
first-order logic), we do not recommend trying to build a learning system using resolution-

19.1.2 Current-best-hypothesis search
CURRENT-BEST- The idea behind current-best-hypothesis search is to maintain a single hypothesis, and to

adjust it as new examples arrive in order to maintain consistency. The basic algorithm was
described by John Stuart Mill(1843), andmaywellhaveappeared evenearlier.
Suppose we have some hypothesis such as h , of which we have grown quite fond.

As long as each new example is consistent, we need do nothing. Then along comes a false
