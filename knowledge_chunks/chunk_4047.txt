where the evidence is the outcome of an experiment or a laboratory test whose results are not completely accurate. In such a case, the certainty factor of the hypothesis must take into account both the strength with which the evidence suggests the hypothesis and the level of confidence in the evidence. MYCIN provides a chaining rule that is defined as follows. Let M/B |A. s] be the measure of belief in A given that we are absolutely sure of the validity of s, Let e be the evidence that led us to believe in 5 (for example, the actual readings of the laboratory instruments or the results of applying other rules). Then: Statistical Reasoning 177 {Re RIC ORNE Nae ERRATA e R ALMA Se MB[h, s] = MB [h, s] - max(0, CF[s, e]) Since initial CF s in MYCIN are estimates that are given by experts who write the nules, it is not really necessary to state a more precise definition of what a CF means than the one we have already given. The original work did, however, provide one by defining MB (which can be thought of as a proportionate decrease in disbelief in / as a result of e) as: 1 if P(A) =1 MBU[h, e| = 4 max[P(Ale), P(A)] P(h) |- Ph) otherwise Similarly, the MD is the proportionate decrease in belief in / as a result of e: 1 if P(h) = 0 MD[A, e] = 5 min[P(h Ale), P(A)] ~ Ph) -P(h) otherwise It turns out that these definitions are incompatible with a Bayesian view of conditional probability. Small changes to them, however, make them compatible [Heckerman, 1986]. In particular, we can redefine MB as 1 if P(A) =1 MB\h, e] = 5 max[P(hle), P(A)] P(A) (1P(h)- Plhte) otherwise The definition of MD must also be changed similarly. With these reinterpretations, there ceases to be any fundamental conflict between MYCIN s techniques and those suggested by Bayesian statistics. We argued at the end of the last section that pure Bayesian statistics usually leads to intractable systems. But MYCIN works [Buchanan and Shonrtliffe, [984]. Why? Each CF in a MYCIN nile represents the contribution
