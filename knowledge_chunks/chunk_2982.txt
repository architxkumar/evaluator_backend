1052 Chapter 27. AI:The Presentand Future
Which waywillthe future go? Science fiction authors seem tofavor dystopian futures
over utopian ones, probably because they make for more interesting plots. But so far, AI

In conclusion, wesee that AI has made great progress in its short history, but the final
sentence of Alan Turing s (1950) essay on Computing Machinery and Intelligence is still
validtoday:

BACKGROUND
A.1 COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS AND O() NOTATION
Computer scientists are often faced with the task of comparing algorithms to see how fast
theyrunorhowmuchmemorytheyrequire. Therearetwoapproaches tothistask. Thefirst
is benchmarking running the algorithms on a computer and measuring speed in seconds

and memory consumption in bytes. Ultimately, this is what really matters, but a benchmark
can be unsatisfactory because it is so specific: it measures the performance of a particular
program written inaparticular language, running onaparticular computer, withaparticular
compiler and particular input data. From the single result that the benchmark provides, it
can be difficult to predict how well the algorithm would do on a diffe
