Thus, the 32-element table for four variables can be constructed from one 8-element table
andone4-elementtable. Thisdecomposition isillustrated schematically in Figure13.4(a).
The property we used in Equation (13.10) is called independence (also marginal in-

All these forms are equivalent (Exercise 13.12). Independence between variables X and Y
canbewrittenasfollows(again, theseareallequivalent):
P(X Y) P(X) or P(Y X) P(Y) or P(X,Y) P(X)P(Y).
Independence assertions are usually based on knowledge of the domain. As the toothache weather example illustrates, they can dramatically reduce the amount of information nec-
essary to specify the full joint distribution. If the complete set of variables can be divided

distributions on those subsets. For example, the full joint distribution on the outcome of n
independent coin flips, P(C ,...,C ), has 2n entries, but it can be represented as the prod-
