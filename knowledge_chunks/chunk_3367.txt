m generic to individual by inserting a referrent ut the same concept type. Join. Combines two identical graphs C, and C by attaching all relation arcs from C, to C, and then erasing C2. Simp!ify. Eliminates one of two identical relations in a conceptual graph when all connecting arcs are also the same. As an example of the use of the formation riles, consider the sentence "Tweety ate a fat worm.' This sentence can be broken down into five basic or cannonical conceptual graphs corresponding to the five words in the sentence. Tweety: [BIRO:tweetvl ate: [Animal] .-(AGENT) l ATE) --. (Patient)-. IENTITYI a: IT: 1 fat: (FAT) - (ATTRIBUTE) - [PHYSICAL-OBJECT] worm: [WORM] The T:d I signifies that something of an unspecified type exists IT is the most general type of all concepts). Sec. 7.2 Associative Networks 135 From these basic graphs a single conceptual graph can be constructed using the formation operators. First, the subgraph from "a fat worm" is constructed by restricting PHYSICAL-OBJECT in the fat graph to WORM and then joining it to the graph for worm to get (FAT] (ATI'RIBUTE) [WORM]. Next. ENTITY in the griph for ate is restricted to WORM and joined to the graph just completed. This gives [ANIMAL] -(AGENT) -[ATE) -. (PATIENT)-. IWORMI -(ATTRIBUTE) -. [FAT]. The final conceptual graph is obtained by restricting ANIMAL to BIRD with referrent Tweety. joining the graphs and labeling the whole graph with PAST (for past tense). (PAST) . ((BIRD: tweetyl - (AGENT) - (EAT) -. (PATIENT) - IWORMI -. (ATTRIBUTE) -. IFATII In forming the above graph, concept specialization occurred (e.g., when restriction took place as in PHYSICAL-OBJECT to WORM). Thus, the formation rules and their inverses provide one method of inference. When rules for handling negation and other basic inference rules are combined with the formation rules, a complete inference system is obtained. This system is truth preserving. The inference rules needed which are the equivalent of those in a PL system a
