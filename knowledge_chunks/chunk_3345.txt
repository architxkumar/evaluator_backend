sets A C U M(0) = 0 m(A) = The function m defines a probability distribution on 2' (not just on the singletons of U as in classical .theory). it represents the measure of belief committed exactly to A. in other words, it is possible to assign belief to each subset A of U without assigning any to anything smaller. A belief function, Bel, corresponding to a specific m for the set A, is defined as the sum of beliefs committed to every subset of A by m. That is. Bel(A) is a measure of the total support or belief committed to the set A and sets a minimum value for its likelihood. It is defined in terms of all belief assigned to A as well as to all proper subsetsof A. Thus. Sec. 6.4 Dempster-Shafer Theory ui Bel(A) m(B) RA For example, if U contains the mutually exclusive subsets A, 8, C, and D then Be I({A,C,D}) m({A,C.D}) + m({A,C}) + m({A,D}) + m({C,D}) + m(1A) + m({C}) + 'n(D} In Dempster-Shafer theory, a belief interval can also be defined for a subset A. It is represented as the subinterval IBel(A). PI(A)1 of 10,11. Bel(A) is also called the support of A, and P1(A) = I - Bel (A), the Plausibility of A. We define Bel (0) = 0 to signify that no belief should be assigned to the empty set and Bel(U) = I to show that the truth is contained within U. The subsets A of U are called the focal elements of the support function Bel when m(A) > 0. Since Bel(A) only partially describes the beliefs about proposition A. it is useful to also have a measure of the extenrone believes in A, that is, the doubts regarding A. For this, we define the doubt of A as D(A) = Bel(-A). From this definition it will be seen that the upper bound of the belief interval noted above. P1(A), can be expressed as P1(A) = 1 - D(A) = I - Bel(-A). P1(A) represents an upper belief limit on the proposition A. The belief interval, IBel(A),P1(A)), is also sometimes referred to as the confidence in A, while the quantity P1(A) - Bel(A) is referred to as the uncertainty in A. It can be shown that (Prade 1983) P1(0
