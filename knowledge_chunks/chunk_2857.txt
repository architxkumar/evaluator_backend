arms (Figure 25.1(a)), are physically anchored to their workplace, for example in a factory
assembly line or on the International Space Station. Manipulator motion usually involves
a chain of controllable joints, enabling such robots to place their effectors in any position
within the workplace. Manipulators are by far the most common type of industrial robots,
with approximately one million units installed worldwide. Some mobile manipulators are
used in hospitals to assist surgeons. Few car manufacturers could survive without robotic
manipulators, andsomemanipulators haveevenbeenusedtogenerate original artwork.
