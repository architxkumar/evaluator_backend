money was almost exactly proportional to the logarithm of the amount. (This idea was first
suggested by Bernoulli (1738); see Exercise 16.3.) Oneparticular utility curve, foracertain
Mr. Beard, is shown in Figure 16.2(a). The data obtained for Mr. Beard s preferences are

into debt is bad, but preferences between different levels of debt can display a reversal of
theconcavity associatedwithpositivewealth. Forexample,someonealready 10,000,000in

That is, agents with curves of this shape are risk-averse: they prefer a sure thing with a

payoff that is less than the expected monetary value of a gamble. On the other hand, in the desperate region at large negative wealth in Figure 16.2(b), the behavior is risk-seeking.
