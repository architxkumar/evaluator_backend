Aprogram called ABSOLVER cangenerate heuristics automatically from problem def-
initions, using the relaxed problem method and various other techniques (Prieditis, 1993).
ABSOLVER generated a new heuristic for the 8-puzzle that was better than any preexisting
heuristic andfoundthefirstusefulheuristicforthefamous Rubik s Cubepuzzle.
One problem with generating new heuristic functions is that one often fails to get a
single clearly best heuristic. If a collection of admissible heuristics h ...h is available
