3.10 Define in your own words the following terms: state, state space, search tree, search
node,goal,action, transition model,andbranching factor.
3.11 What s the difference between a world state, a state description, and a search node?
Whyisthisdistinction useful?
3.12 Anactionsuchas Go(Sibiu)reallyconsistsofalongsequenceoffiner-grainedactions:
turn on the car, release the brake, accelerate forward, etc. Having composite actions of this
kind reduces the number of steps in a solution sequence, thereby reducing the search time.
Supposewetakethistothelogicalextreme,bymakingsuper-composite actions outofevery
possible sequence of Go actions. Then every problem instance is solved by a single super-
composite action, such as Go(Sibiu)Go(Rimnicu Vilcea)Go(Pitesti)Go(Bucharest). Explain
how search would work in this formulation. Is this a practical approach for speeding up
problem solving?
