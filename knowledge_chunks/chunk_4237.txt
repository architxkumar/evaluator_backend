Natural Language Processing 297 So CREEPS RR This test succeeds, so append long to the list contained in the ADJS register. (This list was previously empty.) Stay in state Q6. Do a category test to see if file is an adjective. This test fails. Do a category test to see if file is a noun. This test succeeds, so set ihe NOUN register io file and go to state Q7. Push to PP. Do a category test to see if has is a preposition. This test fails, so pop and signal failure. There is nothing else that can be done from state Q7, so pop and return the structure (NP (FILE (LONG) DEFINITE)) The return causes the machine to be in state QI, with the SUBJ register set to the structure just returned and the TYPE register set to DCL. . Do acategory test to see if has is a verb. This test succeeds, so set the AUX register to NIL and set the V register to has. Go to state Q4. . Push to state NP. Since the next word, printed, is not a determiner or a proper noun, NP will pop and return failure. The only other thing to do in state Q4 is to halt. But more input remains, so a complete parse has not been found. Backtracking is now required. The last choice point was at state QI, so return there. The registers AUX and V must be unset. Do a category test to see if has is an auxiliary. This test succeeds, so set the AUX register 1o has and go to state Q3. Do a category test to see if printed is a verb. This test su
