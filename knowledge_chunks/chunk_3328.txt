 language theory concepts. For this, we define a linguistic variable as the. quintuple (x,T(x),U,G,M) where x is the name of the variable (AGE in the above example), T(x) is the terminal set of x (very-young, young, etc.). U is the universe of discourse (years of life). G is a set of syntactic rules, the grammer which generates the values of x, and M is the semantic rule which associates each value of x with its meaning M(x), a fuzzy subset of U. The grammar G is further defined as the tuple (VN.Vr.P.S) where VN is the set of nonterminal symbols, Vthe set of terminal symbols from the alphabet Of G, P is AGE o to 20 30 40 50 00 70 80 90 100 110 Figure LI The linguistic variable age. 104 Dealing with Inconsistencies and Uncertainties Chap. 5 a set of rewrite (production) rules, and S is the start symbol. The language L(G) generated by the grammar G is the set of all strings w derived from S consisting of symbols in V. Thus, for example, using Vv = {A,B,C,D,E,S} and the following rules in P. we generate the terminal string "not young and not very old." P: S-*A A -'Aandfi C-.D D -iyoung S -'Sor A B -.0 C -. very C E-"old B -'not C This string is generated through application of the following rules: S-'A -. A and B-.A and not C-A and not very C-+A and not very E-'. A and not very old -p B and not very old -. not C and not very old - not D and not very old --' not young and not very old The semantic rule M gives meaning to the values of AGE. For example, we might have M(old) = {(x I u0(x)) J xe [0,11011 where u0 (x) is defined as 0 for Ox50 u04(x) = ( + (X _50)_2)_I for >50 In this section we have been able to give only a brief overview of some of the concepts and issues related to the expanding fields based on fuzzy set theory. The interested reader will find numerous papers and texts available in the literature. We offer a few representative references here which are recent and have extensive bibliographies: (Zadeh, 1977, 1981, 1983), (Kandel, 1982). (Gupta et al., (198
