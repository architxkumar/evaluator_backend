fourthpossibility: flippingavariabletoitsopposite.)
An HLA under angelic semantics can do more: it can control the value of a variable,
setting ittotrueorfalse depending onwhichimplementation ischosen. Infact, an HL Acan
have nine different effects on a variable: if the variable starts out true, it can always keep
it true, always make it false, or have a choice; if the variable starts out false, it can always
keep it false, always make it true, or have a choice; and the three choices for each case can
becombined arbitrarily, making nine. Notationally, this isabitchallenging. We llusethe (cid:23)

A, that is, either leave Aunchanged ormake it true. Similarly, (cid:23)
A means possibly delete
A and (cid:23)
A means possibly add or delete A. For example, the HLA Go(Home,SFO),
