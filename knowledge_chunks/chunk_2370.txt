a. Assume Mary has an exponential utility function with R 500. Mary is given the
choice between receiving 500 with certainty (probability 1) or participating in a lot-
tery which has a 60 probability of winning 5000 and a40 probability of winning
nothing. Assuming Marry acts rationally, which option would she choose? Show how
youderivedyouranswer.

16.13 Repeat Exercise 16.16, using the action-utility representation shown in Figure 16.7.
16.14 For either of the airport-siting diagrams from Exercises 16.16 and 16.13, to which
conditional probability table entry is theutility most sensitive, given the available evidence?
16.15 Considerastudentwhohasthechoicetobuyornotbuyatextbookforacourse. We ll
modelthisasadecision problem withone Booleandecision node, B,indicating whetherthe
agent chooses to buy the book, and two Boolean chance nodes, M, indicating whether the
student has mastered the material in the book, and P, indicating whether the student passes
thecourse. Ofcourse, thereisalso autility node, U. Acertain student, Sam,hasanadditive
utilityfunction: 0fornotbuyingthebookand- 100forbuyingit;and 2000forpassingthe
courseand0fornotpassing. Sam sconditional probability estimatesareasfollows:
P(p b,m) 0.9 P(m b) 0.9
P(p b, m) 0.5 P(m b) 0.7
P(p b,m) 0.8
P(p b, m) 0.3
You might think that P would be independent of B given M, But this course has an open-
