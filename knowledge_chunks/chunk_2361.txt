cussed by Howard (1989). A 1994 survey by the Economist set the value of a life at
between 750,000 and 2.6 million. However, Richard Thaler (1992) found irrational fram-

willing to be paid to accept a risk. For a 1 1000 chance, a respondent wouldn t pay more

The optimizer s curse was brought to the attention of decision analysts in a forceful
way by Smith and Winkler (2006), who pointed out that the financial benefits to the client
projected by analysts for their proposed course of action almost never materialized. They
tracethisdirectly tothebiasintroduced byselecting anoptimal action andshowthatamore
complete Bayesian analysis eliminates the problem. The same underlying concept has been
POST-DECISION called post-decision disappointment by Harrison and March (1984) and was noted in the
DISAPPOINTMENT
context of analyzing capital investment projects by Brown (1974). The optimizer s curse is
also closely related to the winner s curse (Capen et al., 1971; Thaler, 1992), which applies
WINNER SCURSE
to competitive bidding in auctions: whoever wins the auction is very likely to have overes-
timated the value of the object in question. Capen et al. quote a petroleum engineer on the
