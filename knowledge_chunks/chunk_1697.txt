Mu ller (2002). Up to 1997 there were no competent Go programs. Now the best programs
play most of their moves at the master level; the only problem is that over the course of a
game they usually make at least one serious blunder that allows a strong opponent to win.
Whereas alpha beta search reigns in most games, many recent Go programs have adopted
Monte Carlomethodsbasedonthe UCT(upperconfidence bounds ontrees)scheme(Kocsis
and Szepesvari, 2006). The strongest Go program as of 2009 is Gelly and Silver s MOGO
(Wangand Gelly,2007;Gellyand Silver,2008). In August2008, MOG Oscoredasurprising
win against top professional Myungwan Kim, albeit with MOGO receiving a handicap of
nine stones (about the equivalent of a queen handicap in chess). Kim estimated MOGO s
strength at 2 3 dan, the low end of advanced amateur. For this match, MOGO was run on
an 800-processor 15 teraflop supercomputer (1000 times Deep Blue). A few weeks later,

of Go, MOGO is at approximately the 1-dan professional level. Rapid advances are likely
as experimentation continues with new forms of Monte Carlo search. The Computer Go
