The field of robotics also includes prosthetic devices (artificial limbs, ears, and eyes
forhumans), intelligent environments (such as an entire house that is equipped withsensors
andeffectors), andmultibodysystems,whereinroboticactionisachievedthroughswarmsof
smallcooperating robots.
Real robots must cope with environments that are partially observable, stochastic, dy-
namic, and continuous. Many robot environments are sequential and multiagent as well.
Partial observability and stochasticity are the result of dealing with a large, complex world.
Robot cameras cannot see around corners, and motion commands are subject to uncertainty
due to gears slipping, friction, etc. Also, the real world stubbornly refuses to operate faster
