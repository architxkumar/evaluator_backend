the variable x. The equivalences can easily be verified with truth tables such as Table 4,3 and simple arguments for the expressions containing quantifiers. Although Tables 4.4 and 4.3 are similar, there are some notable differences, particularly in the wffs containing quantifiers. For example, attention is called to the last four expressions which govern substitutions involving negated quantifiers and the movement of quantifiers across conjunctive and disjunctive connectives. We summarize here some definitions which are similar to those of the previous section. A wif is said to be valid if it is true under every interpretation. A wif that is false under every interpretation is said to be inconsistent (Or unsatisfiable). A wif ihat is not valid (one that is false for some interpretation) is invalid. Likewise, a wif that is not inconsistent (one that is true for some interpretation) is satisfiable. Again, this means that a valid wif is satisfiable and an inconsistent wif is invalid, TABLE 4.4.

Finally, we say that a w IT Q is a logical consequence of the wffs P1. P2,..., P if and only if whenever P1 & P, & . & P,, is true under an interpretation, Q is also true. To illustrate some of these concepts, consider the following examples: a. P & P is inconsistent and P V P is valid since the first is false under every interpretation and the second is true under every interpret
