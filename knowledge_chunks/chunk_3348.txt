These methods typically have an intuitive, if not a theoretical. appeal. 120 Probabilistic Reasoning Chap. 6 They are chosen over formal methods as a pragmatic solution to a particular problem. when the formal methods impose difficult or impossible conditions. Different ad hoc procedures have been employed successfully in a number of Al systems, particularly in expert systems. We illustrate the basic ideas with the belief measures used in the MYCIN system, one of the earliest expert systems developed to diagnose meningitis and infectious blood diseases (Buchanan and Shottliffe, 1984). MYCIN's knowledge base is composed of if . then rules which are ued to assess various forms of patient evidence with the ultimate goal being the formulation of a correct diagnosis and recommendation for a suitable therapy. A typical rule has the form IF: The Stain of the organism is gram positive, and The morphology of the organism is coccus, and The growth conformation of the organism is chains THEN: There is suggestive evidence (0.7) that the identity of the organism is streptococcus This is a rule that would be used by the inference mechanism to help identify the offending organism. The three conditions given in the IF part of the rule refer to attributes that help to characterize and identify organisms (the stain, morphology, and growth conformation). When such an identification is relatively certain, an appropriate therapy may then be recommended. The numeric value (0.7) given in the THEN part of the abo
