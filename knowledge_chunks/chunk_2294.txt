Somuchfortemporary blips. Whataboutapersistent sensorfailure? Sadly,failures of
this kind are alltoo common. Ifthesensor returns 20 readings of5followed by20 readings
of 0, then the transient sensor failure model described in the preceding paragraph willresult
in the robot gradually coming to believe that its battery is empty when in fact it may be that
the meter has failed. The lower curve in Figure 15.14(b) shows the belief trajectory for
this case. By t 25 five readings of 0 the robot is convinced that its battery is empty.
Obviously, we would prefer the robot to believe that its battery meter is broken if indeed
thisisthemorelikelyevent.
PERSISTENT Unsurprisingly, to handle persistent failure, we need a persistent failure model that
FAILUREMODEL
describes how the sensor behaves under normal conditions and after failure. To do this, we
need to augment the state of the system with an additional variable, say, BM Broken, that
describes the status of the battery meter. The persistence of failure must be modeled by an
