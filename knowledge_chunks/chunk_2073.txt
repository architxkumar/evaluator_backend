Fluents and actions are defined with domain-specific axioms that are similar to successor-
state axioms. For example, we can say that the only way a wumpus-world agent gets an
arrowisatthestart,andtheonlywaytouseupanarrowistoshootit:
Initiates(e,Have Arrow(a),t) e Start
Terminates(e,Have Arrow(a),t) e Shootings(a)
By reifying events we make it possible to add any amount of arbitrary information about
them. For example, we can say that Shankar s flight was bumpy with Bumpy(E ). In an
