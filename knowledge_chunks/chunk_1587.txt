Chapter 3 addressed a single category of problems: observable, deterministic, known envi-
ronmentswherethesolutionisasequenceofactions. Inthischapter,welookatwhathappens
whentheseassumptionsarerelaxed. Webeginwithafairlysimplecase: Sections4.1and4.2
coveralgorithms thatperform purely localsearch inthestate space, evaluating andmodify-
ingoneormorecurrentstatesratherthansystematically exploringpathsfromaninitialstate.
Thesealgorithms are suitable forproblems inwhich allthat mattersisthe solution state, not
thepathcost toreach it. Thefamilyoflocal search algorithms includes methods inspired by
statistical physics(simulatedannealing)andevolutionary biology (geneticalgorithms).
Then, in Sections 4.3 4.4, we examine what happens when we relax the assumptions
ofdeterminismandobservability. Thekeyideaisthatifanagentcannotpredictexactlywhat
percept it will receive, then it will need to consider what to do under each contingency that
its percepts may reveal. With partial observability, the agent will also need to keep track of
thestatesitmightbein.
Finally, Section 4.5investigates onlinesearch, inwhichtheagent isfaced withastate

4.1 LOCAL SEARCH ALGORITHMS AND OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
The search algorithms that we have seen so far are designed to explore search spaces sys-
tematically. Thissystematicity isachieved by keeping one ormore paths in memory and by
recordingwhichalternativeshavebeenexploredateachpointalongthepath. Whenagoalis
found,thepathtothatgoalalsoconstitutesasolutiontotheproblem. Inmanyproblems,how-
ever, the path to the goal is irrelevant. Forexample, in the 8-queens problem (see page 71),

same general property holds for many important applications such as integrated-circuit de-
sign,factory-floorlayout,job-shopscheduling,automaticprogramming,telecommunications
networkoptimization, vehiclerouting, andportfolio management.
