(73s, f: INSIDE(s, c) A JOINED(s, , f ) \ -PORTAL(f)) An open container has (at least) one portal at the top: OPEN-CONTAINER(c) = (as : INSIDE(s, c) A FREE(s)) A (Vs, f: INSIDE(s, c) A JOINED(s, , f) > f= TOP(c) A PORTAL f)) Liquids make things wet. To model wetness, we will find it useful to imagine a solid object as being surrounded by a very thin free space. This space is broken up into a set of thin outer spaces corresponding to the various faces of the object. Objects that touch share these outer spaces. SURROUND(o) = thin space surrounding object 0 Vo : FREE(SURROUND(0)) OUTER(d, 0) = Sf: FACE(f, 0) and d is the thin free space just outside f TOUCHING( ,, 02) = dd : OUTER(A, 0,) \ OUTERQ, 0) Yd, 0 : OUTER(d, 0) > INSIDE(d, SURROUND(0)) Ws, 0 : FREE(s) A INSIDE(o, s) INSIDE(SURROUND(o), s) The last two facts state that SURROUND(e) contains all its outer spaces, and that any larger, free space containing object 0 also contains SURROUND(o), Now we can define wetness as a relation between an outer space d and some generic liquid /: WET-BY(d, J) = CAPACITY(d) > AMOUNT, d) > none IS-WET(o0) = 3d, | : OUTER(d, 0) \ WET-BY(d, !) IS-WET-ALL-OVER(o) = Vd : OUTER(d, 0) - 3: WET-BY(d, /) Suppose our robot encounters a room with six inches of water on the floor. What will happen if the robot touches the floor? By the definition of TOUCHING, we have: dd, : OUTER(d,, Rubot) \ OUTER(d,, Floor) Since the floor only has one face, d, we can conclude: OUTER(d, Robot) \ OUTER(d, Floor) Combining the first clause with the fact WET-BY(d, Water) gives us IS-WET(Eofeoj). In other words, the robot will get wet. Recall that at the end of the last section, our robot was about to try crossing a river without using a bridge. It might find this fact useful: INSIDE(5;, 59) \ FREE(s,} A FULL(53, 1) > FULL(5,, 1) Common Sense 417 It is straightforward to show that if the robot is submerged, it will be wet all over. Pr
