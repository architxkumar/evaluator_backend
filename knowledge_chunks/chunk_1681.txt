nely. The key to its
success seemstohavebeen itsability togenerate singular extensions beyond thedepth limit
forsufficiently interesting lines offorcing forced moves. Insomecases thesearch reached a
depth of 40 plies. Theevaluation function had over8000 features, many of them describing
highly specific patterns of pieces. An opening book of about 4000 positions was used, as
well as a database of 700,000 grandmaster games from which consensus recommendations
could beextracted. Thesystem also used alarge endgame database of solved positions con-
taining all positions with five pieces and many with six pieces. This database had the effect
ofsubstantially extending theeffectivesearchdepth,allowing Deep Bluetoplayperfectlyin

game-playing has come primarily from ever-more-powerful hardware a view encouraged
by IBM. But algorithmic improvements have allowed programs running on standard PCs
to win World Computer Chess Championships. A variety of pruning heuristics are used to
reducetheeffectivebranchingfactortolessthan3(comparedwiththeactualbranchingfactor

lower bound on the value of a position, using a shallow search in which the opponent gets
to move twice at the beginning. This lower bound often allows alpha beta pruning without

HYDRA can be seen as the successor to DEEP BLUE. HYDRA runs on a 64-processor
cluster with1gigabyte perprocessor andwithcustom hardware intheform of FPGA(Field
Programmable Gate Array)chips. HYDR Areaches200millionevaluationspersecond,about
the same as Deep Blue, but HYDRA reaches 18 plies deep rather than just 14 because of
aggressive useofthenullmoveheuristic andforwardpruning.
