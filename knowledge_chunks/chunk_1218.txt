ter. General purpose inference schemes include junction tree algorithm and message passing over factor graph constructed from the belief network. Let us study a famous example, due to Judea Pearl, that is often cited in Bayesian network literature. One fine morning, Anisa noticed that the grass in her lawn was wet. She was puzzled: is it due to overnight rain or it is due to a sprinkler that remained switched on by mistake? She looked around and found that the grass in her neighbour s, Malala s, backyard was also wet. Our model of this situation is shown in Figure 18.1. (Xp) (Xs) RA, XY a a a ay (ay ky) ay) FIGURE 18.1 The Bayesian network captures the causal relation amongst the four statements X,(Anisa s grass is wet), Xj (Malala s grass is wet), Xp (it rained last night), and Xs (Anisa s sprinkler was on by mistake). There are four binary variables in our model. Each variable is either 0 or. X, 1 means Anisa s grass is wet and 0 otherwise. Xy 1 means Malala s grass is wet and 0 otherwise. X 1 means it rained last night and 0 otherwise. Xs 1 means Anisa s sprinkler was on by mistake. The following conditional independencies hold in this example: 1. Anisa s grass can be wet either due to rain or due to a sprinkler. P(X Xu. XR, X) P(X Xp, Xs) 2. Malala s grass can be wet only due to rain. P(X Xp, Xs) P(X Xp) 3. Rain is not influenced by the sprinkler. P(XpR Xs) P(Xp) Thus, P(Xa, Xu XR.

That is, what is the value of P(Xs 1 X4 1)? The calculations are shown below. P(X, 1,.X, ) P(X, ) LD x,.x, (Xs 1,X4 ) 7 D x, Xs P(X, ) Langa, PONG) PMs Ig.
