rting point. A chain code is specified by four ot more direction numbers which give a trace of the directional displacements of successive unit line segments, An example of a four direction chain code is presented in Figure 14.18. Chain cude descriptions are useful for certain types of object matchings. If the starting position is ignored, the chain code is independent of object location. A derivative or difference (m96 4) for a chain code can also be useful since it is invariant under object rotation. The derivative is found by counting the number of 90 degree counterclockwise rotations made from segment to segment. Thus, the derivative for the chain code of Figure 14.18 is the code 100003030010001 03000300003000000000. Other Descriptive Features Some other descriptive features include the area, intensity, orientation. center ul mass, and hounding rectangle. These descriptions are determined in the to Iui way. 20 Figure 14.18 Ia) Region boundary (5) direction numbers, and (C) chain Chan code 11111003330000110000333332222222222 code for region boundary. Sec. 14.4 Describing and Labeling Objects 307 1. The area of a region can be given by a count of the number of pixels contained in the region. 2. The average region intensity is just the average gray-level intensity taken over all pixels in the region. If color is used in the image, the average is given as the three base color intensity averages. 3. The center of mass M. for a region can be computed as the average x-v vector position (denoted as P1), that is M = (I In) P1 4. The scatter matrix S an elliptical area which approximates the shape of the region. It may be computed as the average distance from the center of the region mass as follows. - S,, = (P, - Mi.) (P, - M'.)' where t denotes matrix transposition. 5. The minimum bounding rectangle is found as the rectangular area defined by the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines which pass through the maximum and minimum pixel positions of the region.
