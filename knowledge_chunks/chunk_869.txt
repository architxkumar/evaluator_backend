fine and give names to new concepts. For example, we might want to name the class of films defined above as BFormulaFilm. We can do so by the statement, BFormulaFilm AND Film (EXISTS 2 :Villain (EXISTS 4 :Song (ALL :Actor AND FILLS :MinAge 12 FILLS :LivesIn Mumbai The equivalence statement is a short form for two subsumption statements. The sentence (d, d2) is equivalent to writing (d; d2) and (d2Ed;). In FOL, the above statement would be written as, Vx (BFormulaFilm(x) (Film(x) a Avy v2 (vitv, A Villian(x,v,) A Villian(x,v2)) A ds,s,s,5,(Al1Distinct (s,,5,,53,5,) A Song(x,s,) A Song (x,5,) A Song(x,s,) A Song(x,s54)) A Wz (Actor (x, z) (MinAge(z,12) ALivesin(z, Mumbai) )) Observe that there are no variables in DL expressions, only predicate names that stand for categories and binary relations, and constants from the domain. A predicate name like Film is used here to stand for all objects in the domain that are films. Reasoning about concepts or predicates is called terminological reasoning and constitutes the TBox of a DL, while reasoning about constants is called assertional reasoning and constitutes the ABox of a DL system. The domain or the universe of discourse is represented by the concept Thing. Every element satisfies Thing and every concept is subsumed by Thing. If dis a concept, (d Thing) is true, and If cis a constant, (c Thing) is true. 14.7.2 Inheritance The two questions we are interested in asking are related to inheritance. They are, does a given element satisfy a given class (or concept), and, whether a given class is subsumed by another class. In FOL, we could show subsumption by a process of chaining inferences. For example, given that Dog(fido25) Vx (Dog(x) D Animal(x)) Wx (Animal(x) LivingCreature(x)) We could conclude by a deductive theorem proving process that, LivingCreature(fido25), and Vx (Dog(x) D LivingCreature(x)) The equivalent (given) statements in DL are, fido25 -Dog Dog E Animal Animal LivingCreature And the sentences we want to show
