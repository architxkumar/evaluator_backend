6.5 Solve the cryptarithmetic problem in Figure 6.2 by hand, using the strategy of back-
tracking withforwardcheckingandthe MR Vandleast-constraining-value heuristics.
6.6 Show how a single ternary constraint such as A B C can be turned into three
binary constraints by using an auxiliary variable. You may assume finite domains. (Hint:
Consider a new variable that takes on values that are pairs of other values, and consider
constraints such as X is the first element of the pair Y. ) Next, show how constraints with
morethanthreevariablescanbetreatedsimilarly. Finally,showhowunaryconstraintscanbe
eliminated by altering the domains of variables. This completes the demonstration that any
CS Pcanbetransformed intoa CS Pwithonlybinaryconstraints.
