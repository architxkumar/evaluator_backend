The importance of domain knowledge was also apparent in the area of understanding
natural language. Although Winograd s SHRDLU system forunderstanding natural language
hadengendered agooddealofexcitement,itsdependence onsyntacticanalysiscausedsome
of the same problems as occurred in the early machine translation work. It was able to
overcome ambiguity and understand pronoun references, but this wasmainly because itwas
designed specifically foronearea the blocks world. Several researchers, including Eugene
Charniak, a fellow graduate student of Winograd s at MIT, suggested that robust language
understanding would require general knowledge about the world and a general method for
usingthatknowledge.
At Yale, linguist-turned-AI-researcher Roger Schank emphasized this point, claiming, Thereisnosuchthingassyntax, whichupsetalotoflinguistsbutdidservetostartauseful

Wilensky, 1978; Schank and Riesbeck, 1981; Dyer, 1983) that all had the task of under-
standing naturallanguage. Theemphasis, however,wasless onlanguage perseandmoreon
