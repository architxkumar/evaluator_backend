5.4.1 Evaluationfunctions
An evaluation function returns an estimate of the expected utility of the game from a given
position, just as the heuristic functions of Chapter 3 return an estimate of the distance to
the goal. The idea of an estimator was not new when Shannon proposed it. For centuries,
chess players (and aficionados of othergames) have developed ways ofjudging the value of
a position because humans are even more limited in the amount
