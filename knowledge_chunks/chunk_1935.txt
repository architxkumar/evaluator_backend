In AI, resolution was adopted for question-answering systems by Cordell Green and
Bertram Raphael(1968). Early AIimplementations putagood dealofeffortinto datastruc-
tures that would allow efficient retrieval of facts; this work is covered in AI programming
texts (Charniak etal., 1987; Norvig, 1992; Forbus and de Kleer, 1993). By the early 1970s,
forward chaining was well established in AI as an easily understandable alternative to res-
olution. AI applications typically involved large numbers of rules, so it was important to
develop efficient rule-matching technology, particularly for incremental updates. The tech-
nology forproductionsystems wasdeveloped tosupport suchapplications. Theproduction
system language OPS-5 (Forgy, 1981; Brownston et al., 1985), incorporating the efficient

The SOA Rcognitivearchitecture (Laird etal.,1987;Laird,2008)wasdesignedtohan-
dle very large rule sets up to a million rules (Doorenbos, 1994). Example applications of
SOAR include controlling simulated fighter aircraft (Jones et al., 1998), airspace manage-
ment (Taylor etal., 2007), AI characters forcomputer games(Wintermute etal., 2007), and
training toolsforsoldiers(Wrayand Jones, 2005).
The field of deductive databases began with a workshop in Toulouse in 1977 that
brought together experts in logical inference and database systems (Gallaire and Minker,
1978). Influential workby Chandraand Harel(1980) and Ullman(1985) ledtotheadoption
of Datalogasastandardlanguagefordeductivedatabases. Thedevelopmentofthemagicsets
technique for rule rewriting by Bancilhon et al. (1986) allowed forward chaining to borrow
the advantage of goal-directedness from backward chaining. Current work includes theidea
ofintegrating multipledatabases intoaconsistent dataspace (Halevy,2007).
