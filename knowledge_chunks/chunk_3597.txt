ontains facts and rules about some specialized knowledge domain. An example of a simple knowledge base giving family relationships is illustrated in Figure 15.2. The rules in this figure are given in the same LISP format as those of Section 10.6 which is similar to the format given in the OPSS language as presented by Bronston. Farrell. Kant. and Martin (1985). Each fact and rule is identified with a name (al, a2.... . rt. r2, . . .). For ease in reading. the left side is separated from the right by the implication symbol -. Conjuncts on the left are given within single parentheses (sub!ists). and one or more conclusions may follow the implication symbol. Variables are identified as a symbol preceded by a question mark. It. should be noted that rules found in real working systems may have many conjuncts in the LHS. For example, as many as eight or more are not uncommon.

In PROLOG, rules are written naturally as clauses with both a head and body. For example, a rule about a patient's symptoms and the corresponding diagnosis of hepatitis might read in English as the rule IF: The patient has a chronic disorder, and the sex of the patient is female, and the age of the patient is less than 30, and the patient shows condition A. and test B reveals biochemistry condition C THEN: -conclude the patient's diagnosis IS autoimmune-chronic-hepatitis.
