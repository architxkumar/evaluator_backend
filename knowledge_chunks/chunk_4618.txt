cription of human lightbulb-changing behavior hw WNh Conclusion 531 TTT TIN TTT TTT ANNE TREN EEE TEES One to call the electrician The Statistical Group (1) One to point out that, in the real world, a lightbulb is never on or off, but usually somewhere in between The Planning Group (4) One to define STRIPS-style operators for lightbulb changing One to show that linear planning is not adequate One to show that nonlinear planning is adequate One to show that people don t plan; they simply react to lightbulbs The Robotics Group (7) One to build a vision system to recognize the dead bulb One to build a vision system to locate a new bulb One to figure out how to grasp the lightbulb without breaking it One to figure out the arm solutions that will get the arm to the socket One to organize the construction teams One to hack the planning system One to indicate how the robot mimics human motor behavior in lightbulb-changing The Knowledge Engineering Group (6) One to study electricians changing lightbulbs One to arrange for the purchase of the Lisp machines One to assure the customer that this is a hard problem and that great accomplishments in theory will come from support of this effort The same one can negotiate the project budget One to study related research One to indicate how it is a description of human lightbulb-changing behavior One to call the Lisp hackers The Lisp Hackers (7) One to bring up the network One to order the Chinese food Four to hack on the Lisp debugger, compiler, window system, and microcode One to write the lightbulb-changing program The Connectionist Group (6) One to claim that lightbulb-changing can only be achieved through massive parallelism One to build a baekpropagation network to direct the robot arm One to assign initial random weights to the connections in the network One to train the network by showing it how to change a lightbulb (training shall consist of 500,000 repeated epochs) One to tell the media that the network learns just like a
