Brin and Page (1998) describe the Page Rank algorithm and the implementation of a
Websearchengine. Kleinberg (1999)describes the HIT Salgorithm. Silverstein etal.(1998)
investigate a log of a billion Web searches. The journal Information Retrieval and the pro-
ceedings oftheannual SIGI Rconference coverrecentdevelopments inthefield.
Earlyinformation extraction programs include GUS (Bobrow etal.,1977) and FRUMP
(De Jong, 1982). Recentinformation extraction hasbeenpushed forwardbytheannual Mes-
sage Understand Conferences (MUC), sponsored by the U.S. government. The FASTUS
finite-state system was done by Hobbs et al. (1997). It was based in part on the idea from
Pereira and Wright (1991) of using FS As as approximations to phrase-structure grammars.
Surveys of template-based systems are given by Roche and Schabes (1997), Appelt (1999),

and Muslea (1999). Large databases of facts were extracted by Craven et al. (2000), Pasca
etal.(2006),Mitchell(2007), and Durmeand Pasca(2008).
Freitag and Mc Callum (2000) discuss HM Ms for Information Extraction. CR Fs were
introduced by Lafferty et al. (2001); an example of their use for information extraction is
describedin(Mc Callum,2003)andatutorialwithpractical guidanceisgivenby(Suttonand
Mc Callum,2007). Sarawagi(2007)givesacomprehensive survey.
Banko et al. (2002) present the ASKMSR question-answering system; a similar sys-
tem is due to Kwok et al. (2001). Pasca and Harabagiu (2001) discuss a contest-winning
question-answering system. Twoearly influential approaches toautomated knowledge engi-
