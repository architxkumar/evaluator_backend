Bayes model naive because it is often
NAIVEBAYES
used (as a simplifying assumption) in cases where the effect variables are not actually
conditionally independent given the cause variable. (The naive Bayes model is sometimes
called a Bayesian classifier, a somewhat careless usage that has prompted true Bayesians
to call it the idiot Bayes model.) In practice, naive Bayes systems can work surprisingly
well, even when the conditional independence assumption is not true. Chapter 20 describes
methodsforlearningnaive Bayesdistributions fromobservations.
13.6 THE WUMPUS WORLD REVISITED
Wecan combine of the ideas in this chapter to solve probabilistic reasoning problems in the
wumpusworld. (See Chapter7foracompletedescriptionofthewumpusworld.) Uncertainty
arises in the wumpus world because the agent s sensors give only partial information about
the world. For example, Figure 13.5 shows a situation in which each of the three reachable
squares 1,3 , 2,2 , and 3,1 might contain a pit. Pure logical inference can conclude
nothing aboutwhichsquare ismostlikelytobesafe,soalogicalagentmighthavetochoose

Ouraimistocalculatetheprobabilitythateachofthethree squarescontainsapit. (For
this example we ignore the wumpus and the gold.) The relevant properties of the wumpus
world are that (1) a pit causes breezes in all neighboring squares, and (2) each square other
than 1,1 contains a pit with probability 0.2. The first step is to identify the set of random
variables weneed: As in the propositional logic case, we want one Boolean variable P for each square,
