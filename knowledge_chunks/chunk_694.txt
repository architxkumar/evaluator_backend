One popular method is to introduce another rule to the resolution method called Param n and Wos, 1969). Paramodulation allows one to substitute values directly during resolution. Th follows, m: av (t s) 1: BY ptt) Ir (aV BY p(s)) s the most general unifier for t and . above proof for example applying the paramodulation rule to statements 27 and 1 we directly get, (2 (GP 2xsAbigale) V ( (GP 2x5 ?x)) V (Answer ?x) ut.com is a simpler form of statement 30! ability however is another matter. Also, the resolution method, and any other method operating upor natter, is not decidable. That means that the algorithm may not always terminate. When the goz ness results say that a proof can be found. However, when the goakisippitr nor equivalently t including the negated goal is not unsatisfiable, which means they are satisfiable then the proc e may go into an infinite loop. the domain is finite, then the entire set of FOL statements can be expanded into propositio its. This can be done by exploiting the fact that the universal quantifier is essentially a conjunctior al one a disjunction. For example in a universe of discourse containing the three numbers 1, statements can be expressed in propositional logic. Vx Even(x) can be replaced by (Even(1) A Even(2) A Even(3)) 3 xEven(x) can be replaced by (Even(1) V Even(2) V Even(3)) V xz (LessThan(x, z)) can be replaced by? , (LessThan(1, 1) V LessThan(1, 2) V LessThan(1, 3)) A (LessThan(2, 1) V LessThan(2, 2) V LessThan(2, 3)) A (LessThan(3, 1) V LessThan(3, 2) V LessThan(3, 3)
