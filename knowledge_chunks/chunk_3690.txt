The functions f1(x) and f2(x) are any real-valued functions of x, and S has been set to the first specific problem instance. (Operators between G and S are implicitly contained in the version space.) In solving the first integral above, the Problem Solver finds that operator 0P6, integration by parts, is applicable. For this operator, two different bindings are possible (a) a = 2x (b) u = sin(x) dv = sin(x)dc dv=2xd.x If the bindings given by a are used, 0P6 produces the new expression * ( cos(x)) - f2 * ( cos(x))dx which can be further reduced using 0P2. ON and other simplification operators to give the correcf solution * cos(x) + 2 * sin(x) + C For this binding, the Critic will label this as a positive instance.

This negative instance will be used to adjust the version space to exclude this instance by specializing the G integrand to either poly(x) * f2(x) dx or to f1(x) * tran(x) dx with corresponding bindings U = poly(x) and u = fi(x) dv = f2(x) dx dv = tran(x) dx both of which exclude the negative insta
