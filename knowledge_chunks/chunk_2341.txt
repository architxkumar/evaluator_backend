16.4.2 Preference structure and multiattribute utility

Preferences withoutuncertainty
Let us begin with the deterministic case. Rememberthat for deterministic environments the
agent has a value function V(x ,...,x ); the aim is to represent this function concisely.

The basic regularity that arises in deterministic preference structures is called preference
PREFERENCE independence. Twoattributes X and X are preferentially independent of a third attribute
