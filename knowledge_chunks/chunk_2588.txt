fications. To illustrate this, we will use the problem of learning
family relationships from examples. The descriptions will consist of an extended family
tree, described in terms of Mother, Father, and Married relations and Male and Female
properties. As an example, we will use the family tree from Exercise 8.14, shown here in
Figure19.11. Thecorresponding descriptions areasfollows:
Father(Philip,Charles) Father(Philip,Anne) ...
Mother(Mum,Margaret) Mother(Mum,Elizabeth) ...
Married(Diana,Charles) Married(Elizabeth,Philip) ...
Male(Philip) Male(Charles) ...
Female(Beatrice) Female(Margaret) ...
