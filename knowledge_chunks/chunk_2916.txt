Thecontrolofrobotsasdynamicalsystems whetherformanipulationornavigation has generated a huge literature that is barely touched on by this chapter. Important works
include a trilogy on impedance control by Hogan (1985) and a general study of robot dy-
namics by Featherstone (1987). Deanand Wellman (1991) were among the firstto try to tie

HAPTICFEEDBACK
Potential-field control, which attempts to solve the motion planning and control prob-
lemssimultaneously, wasintroduced into therobotics literature by Khatib(1986). Inmobile
robotics, thisideawasviewedasapractical solution tothe collision avoidance problem, and
VECTORFIELD was later extended into an algorithm called vector field histograms by Borenstein (1991).
HISTOGRAMS
Navigation functions, the robotics version of a control policy for deterministic MD Ps, were
introduced by Koditschek(1987). Reinforcementlearninginroboticstookoffwiththesemi-

The topic of software architectures for robots engenders much religious debate. The
good old-fashioned AI candidate the three-layer architecture dates back to the design of

although similar ideas were developed independently by Braitenberg (1984), whose book,
Vehicles, describes a series of simple robots bas
