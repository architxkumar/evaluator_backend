Mental objects have been the subject of intensive study in philosophy and AI. There
arethreemainapproaches. Theonetaken inthis chapter, based onmodallogic andpossible
worlds, is the classical approach from philosophy (Hintikka, 1962; Kripke, 1963; Hughes
and Cresswell, 1996). Thebook Reasoning about Knowledge(Faginetal.,1995)provides a
thorough introduction. The second approach is a first-order theory in which mental objects
arefluents. Davis(2005) and Davisand Morgenstern (2005)describe thisapproach. Itrelies
on the possible-worlds formalism, and builds on work by Robert Moore (1980, 1985). The
third approach is a syntactic theory, in which mental objects are represented by character

strings. A string is just a complex term denoting a list of symbols, so Can Fly(Clark) can
be represented by the list of symbols C,a,n,F,l,y,(,C,l,a,r,k,) . The syntactic theory
of mental objects was first studied in depth by Kaplan and Montague (1960), who showed
that it led to paradoxes if not handled carefully. Ernie Davis (1990) provides an excellent
comparison ofthesyntactic andmodaltheories ofknowledge.
The Greek philosopher Porphyry (c. 234 305 A.D.), commenting on Aristotle s Cat-
egories, drew what might qualify as the first semantic network. Charles S. Peirce (1909)
developed existential graphs as the first semantic network formalism using modern logic.
