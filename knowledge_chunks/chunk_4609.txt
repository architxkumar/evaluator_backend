The first predicate with an arity of 4 takes in the name of the agent and provides the associated handler, port number and list of assigned links. For example, | ?- agent_data(me, Handler, Port, Agent Links List). will provide Handler = me_handler, Port = 2000, Agent Links List = [0,2]. } : ; PROLOG - The Natural Language of Artificial Intelligence 523 Synonym to Sentence Li Antonym to Synonym Link Give me a word & PR get you more information on it Fig. 25.1 Flow of Information Amongst the Three Agents The second agent_data predicate has an arity of 5 and given the agent name and link number returns a random atom which is the Winsock Socket handler, a string representing the host IP address and the associated port. | ?- agent_data(me, 0, Sock, Host IP, Port). would possibly result in Sock = hdisnfgj, IP = 202.141.80.66, Port = 4000 ({c) agent_close/1 The predicate takes in the name of the agent and shuts itself down. It is always best to close an agent when it has performed its functions. Try to incorporate the same as event handlers in the above programs. Do bear in mind that the above agents are not yet intelligent. You could make them so by providing appropriate handler programs that will facilitate intelligent responses by the respective agents. Having talked of agents, their functionality and implementation using Chimera we go ahead to providing a better method of interacting with such systems. 524 Artificial Intelligence SACS NOIR 25.15.2 Creating Dialogues Dialogues provide the visual effect and give a better aesthetic appearance to inputs and outputs.
