We now possess an arsenal of techniques for creating computer programs that control manufacturing processes, diagnose computer faults and human diseases, design computers, do insurance underwriting, play grandmaster-level chess, and so on. Basic research in AI has expanded enormously during this period. For the student, extracting theoretical and practical knowledge from such a large body of scientific knowledge is a daunting task. The goal of the first edition of this book was to provide a readable introduction to the problems and techniques of AI. In this edition, we have tried to achieve the same goal for the expanded field that AI bas become. In particular, we have tried to present both the theoretical foundations of AJ and an indication of the ways that current techniques can be used in application programs. As a result
