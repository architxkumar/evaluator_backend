ry of set theory as syntactic sugar. The empty set is a
constant written as . There is one unary predicate, Set, which is true of sets. The binary
predicates are x s (x is a memberof set s)and s s (set s is a subset, not necessarily

proper, of set s ). The binary functions are s s (the intersection of two sets), s s

(the union of two sets), and x s (the set resulting from adjoining element x to set s). One
possible setofaxiomsisasfollows:
1. Theonlysetsaretheemptysetandthosemadebyadjoining something toaset: s Set(s) (s ) ( x,s Set(s ) s x s ).

2. The empty set has no elements adjoined into it. In other words, there is no way to
decompose intoasmallersetandanelement: x,s x s .
3. Adjoininganelementalreadyinthesethasnoeffect: x,s x s s x s .
4. The only members of a set are the elements that were adjoined into it. We express
this recursively, saying that x is a member of s if and only if s is equal to some set s
