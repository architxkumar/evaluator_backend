ow been outlined. The other major task of a TMS is resolving contradictions. In a TMS, a contradiction node does not represent a logical contradiction but rather a state of the database explicitly declared to be undesirabie. (In the next section, we describe a slightly different kind of TMS in which this is not the case.) In our example, we Beneficiary Abbott [IN] Beneficiary Cabot [IN] Suspect Abbott (OUT] + < Alibi Abbott [IN] | Registered Abbott [IN] Far away [IN] i Register forged {OUT) Fig. 7.7 Changed Labeling Suspect Babbitt [OUT] + Beneficiary Babbitt [IN] Alibi Babbitt ((N] !

Telis Truth Cabot [OUT] Fig.7.9 Cabot s justification + Contradiction Other Suspects Suspect Abbott Suspect Babbitt Suspect Cabot Fig. 7.10 A Contradiction Symbolic Reasoning Under Uncertainty 165 SRC NITE ERASED ERRANDS INSECTS have a contradiction if we do not have at least one murder suspect. Thus a contradiction might have the justification shown in Fig. 7.10, where the node Other Suspects means that there are suspects other than Abbott, Babbitt, and Cabot. This is one way of explicitly representing an instance of the closed world assumption. Later, if we discover a long-lost relative, this will provide a valid justification for Other Suspects. But for now, it has none and must be labeled OUT. Fortunately, even though Abbott and Babbitt are not suspects, Suspect Cabot is labeled IN, invalidating the justification for the contradiction. While the contradiction is labeled OUT, there is no contradiction to resolve. Now we learn that Cabot was seen on television attending the ski tournament. Adding this to the dependency network first illustrates the fact that nodes can have more than one + = justification as shown in Fig. 7.11. Not only does Cabot say he was at the ski slopes, but he was _ Cabot [IN] Alibi Cabot [IN] * seen there on television, and we have no reason to believ
