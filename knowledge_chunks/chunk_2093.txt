12.6.2 Truth maintenance systems
Wehave seen that many of the inferences drawn by a knowledge representation system will
have only default status, rather than being absolutely certain. Inevitably, some of these in-
ferredfactswillturnouttobewrongandwillhavetoberetractedinthefaceofnewinforma-
tion. This process is called belief revision.10 Suppose that a knowledge base KB contains
BELIEFREVISION
a sentence P perhaps a default conclusion recorded by a forward-chaining algorithm, or
perhaps just an incorrect assertion and we want to execute TELL(KB, P). Toavoid cre-
ating a contradiction, we must first execute RETRACT(KB, P). This sounds easy enough.

Problems arise, however, if any additional sentences were inferred from P and asserted in

One simple approach to truth maintenance is to keep track of the order in which sen-
tences are told to the knowledge base by numbering them from P to P . When the call
