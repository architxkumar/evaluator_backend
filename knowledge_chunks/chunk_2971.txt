difficulty is coping with courses of action such as having a conversation or a cup of tea that consist eventually of thousands ormillions of primitive steps fora real agent. It is only
by imposing hierarchical structure on behavior that we humans cope at all. We saw in
Section 11.2 how to use hierarchical representations to handle problems of this scale; fur-
thermore, work in hierarchical reinforcement learning has succeeded in combining some
ofthese ideas withthe techniques fordecision making under uncertainty described in Chap-
