w if students are getting enough sleep. Each day, the pro-
fessor observes whether the students sleep in class, and whether they have red eyes. The
professorhasthefollowingdomaintheory: Thepriorprobability ofgetting enoughsleep,withnoobservations, is0.7. The probability of getting enough sleep on night t is 0.8 given that the student got
enoughsleeptheprevious night,and0.3ifnot. Theprobability ofhaving redeyesis0.2ifthestudent gotenough sleep,and0.7ifnot. Theprobabilityofsleepinginclassis0.1ifthestudentgotenoughsleep,and0.3ifnot.
Formulate this information as a dynamic Bayesian network that the professor could use to
filter or predict from a sequence of observations. Then reformulate it as a hidden Markov
model that has only a single observation variable. Give the complete probability tables for
themodel.
