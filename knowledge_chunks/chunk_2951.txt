Peoplemightlose theirjobsto automation. Themodern industrial economy has be-

much of the economy, especially in the United States, depends on the availability of con-
sumer credit. Credit card applications, charge approvals, and fraud detection are now done
by AI programs. One could say that thousands of workers have been displaced by these AI
programs, but in fact if you took away the AI programs these jobs would not exist, because
human laborwould addanunacceptable costtothetransactions. Sofar, automation through
information technology in general and AI in particular has created more jobs than it has
eliminated, and has created more interesting, higher-paying jobs. Nowthat thecanonical AI
