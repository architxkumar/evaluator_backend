primitive acticn INGEST with unfilled slots for ACTOR. OBJECT, and TENSE. (INGEST (ACTOR nil) (OBJECT oil) (TENSE past)) Subsequent words in the input string would initiate actions to add to this structure and fill in the empty ACTOR and OBJECT slots. Thus, a simple sentence like The boy drank a soda would be transformed through a series of test and action steps to produce a structure such as the following. (INGEST (ACTOR (PP (NAME boy) (CLASS PHYS-OBJ) (TYPE ANIMATE) (REF DEF))) (OBJECT (PP (NAME soda) (CLASS PHYS-OBJ) (TYPE INANIMATE) (REF INDEF))) (TENSE PAST)) ompositional Semantics Approaches n the compositional semantics approach, the meaning of an expression is derived rom the meanings of the parts of the expression. The target knowledge Structures onstructed in this approach are typically logic expressions such as the formulas of DPL. The LUNAR system developed by Woods (1978) uses this approach. The iput strings are first parsed using an ATN from which a syntactic tree is output. his becomes the input to a semantic interpreter which interprets the meaning of ie syntactic tree and Creates the semantic representations. Sec. 12.6 Natural Language Generation 259 As an example, suppose the following declaration is submitted to LUNAR Sample24 contains silicon This would be parsed, and the following tree structure would be output from the ATN; IS DCL (NP (N (Samp(e24()) f AUX (TENSE (PRESENT))) (VP (V (contain)) (NP IN (silicon)))) Using this structure, the semantic interpreter would produce the predicate clause (CONTAIN samp(o24 silicon) which has the FOPL meaning you would expect. The interpreter used in LUNAR is driven by semantic pattern - action interpretation rules. The rule that builds the CONTAIN predicate is selected whenever the input tree has a verb of the form have or contain and a sample as the subject and either chemical element, isotope, or oxide as an object. The action of the rule states that such a sentence is to be interpreted as an instance of
