ther. extreme, the BABEL system generates output text from conceptual dependency and script structures. We concluded the chapter with a look at three s stems of somewhat disparate architectures: the LUNAR. LIFER, and SFIRDLU systems. These systems typtf. the state-of-the-art in natural language processing sy'crns. EXERCISES 12.1.
