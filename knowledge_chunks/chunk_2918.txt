 DARPA in 2004 and 2005, required
CHALLENGE
autonomous robots to travel more than 100 miles through unrehearsed desert terrain in less
than 10 hours (Buehler et al., 2006). In the original event in 2004, no robot traveled more
than 8miles, leading manyto believe the prize would neverbe claimed. In 2005, Stanford s
robot STANLEY wonthe competition in just under 7 hours of travel (Thrun, 2006). DARPA
thenorganizedthe Urban Challenge,acompetitioninwhichrobotshadtonavigate60miles

in an urban environment with other traffic. Carnegie Mellon University s robot BOSS took
firstplaceandclaimedthe 2millionprize(Urmsonand Whittaker, 2008). Earlypioneersin
thedevelopmentofroboticcarsincluded Dickmannsand Zapp(1987)and Pomerleau(1993).
Twoearly textbooks, by Dudek and Jenkin (2000) and Murphy (2000), cover robotics
generally. A more recent overview is due to Bekey (2008). An excellent book on robot
manipulation addresses advanced topics such as compliant motion (Mason, 2001). Robot
motion planning is covered in Choset et al. (2004) and La Valle (2006). Thrun et al. (2005)
provide an introduction into probabilistic robotics. The premiere conference for robotics is
Robotics: Science and Systems Conference, followed bythe IEEE International Conference
on Roboticsand Automation. Leadingroboticsjournalsinclude IEEE Roboticsand Automa-
tion,the International Journalof Robotics Research,and Roboticsand Autonomous Systems.
