entity may be viewed as an agent, but we have not explained which entities must be viewed
as agents. Does an agent A (the taxi driver for example) have to treat an object B (another

iswhether B sbehaviorisbestdescribedasmaximizingaperformancemeasurewhosevalue
depends on agent A s behavior. For example, in chess, the opponent entity B is trying to
maximize its performance measure, which, by the rules of chess, minimizes agent A s per-

all agents, so it is a partially cooperative multiagent environment. It is also partially com-
