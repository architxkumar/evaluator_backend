In the remainder of this section, we outline four basic kinds of agent programs that
embodytheprinciples underlying almostallintelligent systems: Simplereflexagents; Model-based reflexagents; Goal-basedagents; and Utility-based agents.
Each kind of agent program combines particular components in particular ways to generate
actions. Section2.4.6explains ingeneral termshowtoconvert alltheseagents into learning

whose agent function is tabulated in Figure 2.3is asimple reflexagent, because its decision
is based only on the current location and on whether that location contains dirt. An agent

Noticethatthevacuumagentprogramisverysmallindeedcomparedtothecorrespond-
ing table. The most obvious reduction comes from ignoring the percept history, which cuts
down the number of possibilities from 4T to just 4. A further, small reduction comes from
thefactthatwhenthecurrent squareisdirty,theactiondoesnotdepend onthelocation.
Simple reflex behaviors occur even in more complex environments. Imagine yourself
