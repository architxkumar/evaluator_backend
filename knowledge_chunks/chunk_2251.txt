14.17 Consider the problem of generating a random sample from a specified distribution
on a single variable. Assume you have a random number generator that returns a random
numberuniformly distributed between0and1.
a. Let X be a discrete variable with P(X x ) p for i 1,...,k . The cumulative
i i
CUMULATIVE distributionof X givestheprobability that X x ,...,x foreachpossiblej. (See
DISTRIBUTION 1 j
also Appendix A.) Explain how to calculate the cumulative distribution in O(k) time
and how to generate a single sample of X from it. Can the latter be done in less than
O(k)time?
b. Nowsuppose wewanttogenerate N samplesof X,where N k. Explainhowtodo
