L (Joe) = 0.5. Of course, our assignment of values for u A(x) was purely subjective. And to be complete,, we should also assign values to other fuzzy sets associated with linguistic variables such as very short, short, medium, etc. We will discuss the notions of linguistic variables and related topics later. Operations on fuzzy sets are somewhat similar to the operations of standard set theory. They are also intuitively acceptable. A = if and only if u A(x) u8(x) for all x U equality A B if and only if UA(x) u8(x) for all x E U containment u Afl R(x) = min,{u4 x).u8(x)} intersection UAUR() = max,{u A(x),a B(x)} - union = I - u A(x) complement set The single quotation mark denotes the complement fuzzy set. A'. Note that the intersection of two fuzzy sets A and is the largest fuzzy subset that is a subset of Sec. 5.6 Fuzzy Logic and Natural Language Computations 99 both. Likewise, the union of two fuzzy sets A and A is the smallest fuzzy subset having both A and B as subsets. With the above definitions, it is possible to derive a number of properties which hold for fuzzy sets much the same as they do for standard Sets. For example. we have A U (B fl C) = (A U B) fl (A U C) distributivity An EUC=Afl UAfl C (A U B) U C = A U (B UC) associativity n fl fl (A B) fl C=A (B C) Afl Afl A. AUUA commutativit3.

A number of operations that are unique to fuzzy sets have been defined. A few of the
