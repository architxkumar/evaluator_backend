Robotic teleoperation, or telepresence, is another form of human augmentation. Tele-
operation involves carrying out tasks over long distances with the aid of robotic devices.
A popular configuration for robotic teleoperation is the master slave configuration, where
a robot manipulator emulates the motion of a remote human operator, measured through a
haptic interface. Underwater vehicles are often teleoperated; the vehicles can go to a depth

25.9 SUMMARY
Robotics concerns itself with intelligent agents that manipulate the physical world. In this
chapter, wehavelearned thefollowingbasicsofrobothardwareandsoftware. Robots are equipped with sensors for perceiving their environment and effectors with
which they can assert physical forces on their environment. Most robots are either
manipulators anchored atfixedlocations ormobilerobotsthatcanmove. Robotic perception concerns itself with estimating decision-relevant quantities from
sensor data. To do so, we need an internal representation and a method for updating
this internal representation overtime. Commonexamples of hard perceptual problems
includelocalization, mapping,andobjectrecognition. Probabilisticfilteringalgorithmssuchas Kalmanfiltersandparticle filtersareuseful
