l physical interaction with
the environment. For example, robot manipulators must know the location of objects they
seektomanipulate; navigating robotsmustknowwheretheyaretofindtheirwayaround.
To keep things simple, let us consider a mobile robot that moves slowly in a flat 2D
world. Letusalso assume therobot isgiven anexact mapofthe environment. (Anexample
of such a map appears in Figure 25.10.) The pose of such a mobile robot is defined by its
two Cartesian coordinates with values x and y and its heading with value , as illustrated in
Figure25.8(a). Ifwearrange those threevalues inavector, thenanyparticular stateisgiven
