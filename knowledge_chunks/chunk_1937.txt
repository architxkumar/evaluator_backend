Texts on logic programming and Prolog, including Shoham (1994), Bratko (2001),
Clocksin (2003), and Clocksin and Mellish (2003). Priorto 2000, the Journal of Logic Pro-
gramming was the journal of record; it has now been replaced by Theory and Practice of
Logic Programming. Logic programming conferences include the International Conference
on Logic Programming(ICLP)andthe International Logic Programming Symposium(ILPS).
Research into mathematical theorem proving began even before the first complete
first-order systemsweredeveloped. Herbert Gelernter s Geometry Theorem Prover(Gelern-
ter, 1959) used heuristic search methods combined withdiagrams forpruning false subgoals
and was able to prove some quite intricate results in Euclidean geometry. The demodula-
tion and paramodulation rules for equality reasoning were introduced by Wos et al. (1967)
and Wosand Robinson (1968), respectively. Theserules were also developed independently
in the context of term-rewriting systems (Knuth and Bendix, 1970). The incorporation of
equalityreasoningintotheunificationalgorithmisdueto Gordon Plotkin(1972). Jouannaud
and Kirchner (1991) survey equational unification from a term-rewriting perspective. An
overviewofunification isgivenby Baaderand Snyder(2001).
A number of control strategies have been proposed for resolution, beginning with the
unitpreferencestrategy(Wosetal.,1964). Theset-of-support strategywasproposedby Wos
et al. (1965) to provide a degree of goal-directedness in resolution. Linear resolution first
appeared in Loveland (1970). Genesereth and Nilsson (1987, Chapter5) provide ashort but
thorough analysis ofawidevarietyofcontrolstrategies.
