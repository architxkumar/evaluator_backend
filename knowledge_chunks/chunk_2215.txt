be easier to view predicates as functions that return true or false.) We will also assume a

and so on. These are exactly the variables appearing in Figure 14.17(b). Because each type
hasonlyfinitelymanyinstances, thenumberofbasicrandomvariables isalsofinite.
To complete the RPM, we have to write the dependencies that govern these random
variables. Thereisonedependency statement foreachfunction, whereeachargument ofthe
function isalogicalvariable (i.e.,avariablethatranges overobjects, asinfirst-orderlogic):
Honest(c) (cid:16)0.99,0.01(cid:17)
Kindness(c) (cid:16)0.1,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.3(cid:17)
Quality(b) (cid:16)0.05,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.15(cid:17)
Recommendation(c,b) Rec CPT(Honest(c),Kindness(c),Quality(b))
where Rec CPT is a separately defined conditional distribution with 2 5 5 50 rows,
each with 5 entries. The semantics of the RPM can be obtained by instantiating these de-
pendencies for all known constants, giving a Bayesian network (as in Figure 14.17(b)) that
definesajointdistribution overthe RPM srandomvariables.8
