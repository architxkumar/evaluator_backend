and the sameindependence would hold forpreferences between any other pairof values for
Noise and Cost. It is also apparent that Cost and Deaths are preferentially independent of
Noise and that Noise and Deaths are preferentially independent of Cost. We say that the
MUTUAL set ofattributes Noise,Cost,Deaths exhibits mutualpreferential independence(MPI).
PREFERENTIAL
INDEPENDENCE
MPI says that, whereas each attribute may be important, it does not affect the way in which
onetradesofftheotherattributes againsteachother.
Mutual preferential independence is something of a mouthful, but thanks to a remark-
