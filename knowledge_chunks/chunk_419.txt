 preceding statement true or false, in context of the game of chess? Justify your answer. 7. Modify the algorithm given in Figure 8.17 to keep track of depth. Write the terminal(node) function. . Modify the algorithms given in Figures 8.17 and Figure 8.18 so that they also return the set of moves available to MAX after two plies (for each possible node) along with their backed-up values. 9. Modify the AlphaBeta algorithm to use the backed-up values stored in the above question, to order the moves of the algorithm in the next cycle. 10. In Section 8.2.2, we have observed that a V(J) b where, a max a4, Ao, a3, ... , and B min B1, Bo, Bs, ..- Argue that the following condition holds for V(J) to influence the root node. wo aun Gy ay ag ...

Starting with a randomly chosen number, construct a 4-ply binary game tree with no cutoffs when explored by the AlphaBeta algorithm. Reverse the tree, and try the AlphaBeta algorithm again on it. 13. Construct a 4-ply binary game tree, using only the values 0 and 1 for the leaf nodes, such that there are no cutoffs with the AlphaBeta algorithm searching from left to right. 14. Show how the algorithm AlphaBeta explores the game tree, searching from left to right. (a) Fill in the leaves that are inspected by AlphaBeta. (b) Show the cutoffs and label them with their type. (c) Mark the move that A phaBeta will choose for MAX at the root. O0000 15 16 14 13 12 16 18 1) 16 14:18 15 13 16 16 14 13: 10 14 15 16 15 17 13-15 FIGURE 8.45 A small game tree. 15. Would the Minimax algorithm have chosen the same move? Give reasons. 16. In the game tree on the following page, the leaves are labelled with the values from the evaluation function. The letter labels A ... X below the leaves are names of the leaves. Show the order in which algorithm SSS will inspect the nodes, explaining all the decisions
