d. Give an upper bound on the total size of the state space defined by your formulation.
(Hint: think about the maximum branching factor for the construction process and the
maximumdepth, ignoring theproblem ofoverlapping pieces andloose ends. Beginby
pretending thateverypieceisunique.)
3.17 On page 90, we mentioned iterative lengthening search, an iterative analog of uni-
form cost search. The idea is to use increasing limits on path cost. If a node is generated
whose path cost exceeds the current limit, it is immediately discarded. For each new itera-
tion,thelimitissettothelowestpathcostofanynodediscarded inthepreviousiteration.
a. Showthatthisalgorithm isoptimalforgeneralpathcosts.
b. Consider a uniform tree with branching factor b, solution depth d, and unit step costs.

3.18 Describe astate space inwhichiterative deepening search performs muchworsethan
depth-firstsearch(forexample, O(n2)vs. O(n)).
