lopedia of Artificial Intelligence [Shapiro and Eckroth, 1987], both of which contain articles on each of the major topics in the field. Four other books that provide good overviews of the field are Artificial Intelligence [Winston, 1984], Introduction to Artificial Intelligence [Charniak and Mc Dermott, 1985], Logical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence [Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987], and The Elements of Artificial Intelligence [Tanimoto, 1987]. Of more restricted scope is Principles of Artificial Intelligence [Nilsson, 1980], which contains a formal treatment of some general-purpose AI techniques. 22 Artificial Intelligence The history of research in artificial intelligence is a fascinating story, related by Pamela Mc Cordiick [1979] in her book Machines Who Think. Because almost all of what we call Al has been developed over the last 30 years, Mc Corduck was able to conduct her research for the book by actually interviewing almost all of the people whose work was influential in forming the field. Most of the work conducted in AI has been originally reported in journal articles, conference proceedings, or technical reports. But some of the most interesting of these papers have later appeared in special collections published as books. Computers and Thought [Feigenbaum and Feldman, 1963] is a very early collection of this sort. Later ones include Simon and Siklossy [1972], Schank and Colby [1973], Bobrow and Collins [1975], Waterman and Hayes-Roth [1978], Findler [1979], Webber and Nilsson [1981], Halpern [1986], Shrobe [1988], and several others that are mentioned in later chapters in connection with specific topics.For newer AI paradigms the book Fundamentals of the New Artificial Intelligence [Toshinori Munakata, 1998] is a good one. The major journal of AI research is called simply Artificial Intelligence. In addition, Cognitive Science is devoted to papers dealing with the overlapping areas of psychology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Al Magazine
