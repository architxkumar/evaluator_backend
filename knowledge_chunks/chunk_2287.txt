What does it mean for a system to be unsmooth or poorly behaved ? Technically,
it means that there is significant nonlinearity in system response within the region that is close (according to the covariance ) to the current mean . To understand this idea

in nontechnical terms, consider the example of trying to track a bird as it flies through the
jungle. The bird appears to be heading at high speed straight for a tree trunk. The Kalman
