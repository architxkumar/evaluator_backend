and to the establishment of problem solving as the canonical AI task. Work in operations
research by Richard Bellman (1957) showed the importance of additive path costs in sim-
plifying optimization algorithms. The text on Automated Problem Solving by Nils Nilsson
(1971)established theareaonasolidtheoretical footing.
Most of the state-space search problems analyzed in this chapter have a long history
in the literature and are less trivial than they might seem. The missionaries and cannibals
problem used in Exercise 3.9 was analyzed in detail by Amarel (1968). It had been consid-
ered earlier in AIby Simonand Newell(1961) and inoperations research by Bellman and
Dreyfus(1962).
The8-puzzle isasmallercousin ofthe15-puzzle, whosehistory isrecounted atlength
by Slocum and Sonneveld (2006). It was widely believed to have been invented by the fa-
mous American game designer Sam Loyd, based on his claims to that effect from 1891 on-
ward(Loyd, 1959). Actually itwasinvented by Noyes Chapman, apostmasterin Canastota,
New York, in the mid-1870s. (Chapman was unable to patent his invention, as a generic
patentcoveringslidingblockswithletters,numbers,orpictureswasgrantedto Ernest Kinsey
in1878.) Itquickly attracted theattention ofthepublic andofmathematicians (Johnson and
Story, 1879; Tait, 1880). The editors of the American Journal of Mathematics stated, The 15 puzzleforthelastfewweekshasbeenprominentlybeforethe Americanpublic,andmay
safely be said to have engaged the attention of nine out of ten persons of both sexes and all

The 8-queens problem was first published anonymously in the German chess maga-
zine Schach in 1848; it was later attributed to one Max Bezzel. It was republished in 1850
and at that time drew the attention of the eminent mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who
