We have defined AI as the study of rational action, which means that planning devising a
plan of action to achieve one s goals is a critical part of AI. We have seen two examples
of planning agents so far: the search-based problem-solving agent of Chapter 3 and the hy-
brid logical agent of Chapter 7. In this chapter we introduce a representation for planning

10.1 DEFINITION OF CLASSICAL PLANNING
The problem-solving agent of Chapter 3 can find sequences of actions that result in a goal
state. Butitdealswithatomicrepresentations ofstates andthus needsgood domain-specific
heuristicstoperformwell. Thehybridpropositional logicalagentof Chapter7canfindplans
without domain-specific heuristics because it uses domain-independent heuristics based on
the logical structure of the problem. But it relies on ground (variable-free) propositional
inference, whichmeansthatitmaybeswampedwhentherearemanyactionsandstates. For
