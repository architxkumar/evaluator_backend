then move the other three. This gait works well on flat terrain. On rugged terrain, obstacles
may prevent a leg from swinging forward. This problem can be overcome by a remarkably
simple control rule: when a leg s forward motion is blocked, simply retract it, lift it higher,

in this chapter exhibit emergent behavior, due to the fact that no model is perfect. Histori-
cally, however, the term has been reserved for control techniques that do not utilize explicit
environmental models. Emergentbehaviorisalsocharacteristic ofbiological organisms.
