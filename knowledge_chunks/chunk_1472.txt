Fully observable vs. partially observable: If an agent s sensors give it access to the
FULLYOBSERVABLE
PARTIALLY complete state of the environment at each point in time, then we say that the task environ-
OBSERVABLE
ment is fully observable. A task environment is effectively fully observable if the sensors
detect all aspects that are relevant tothe choice of action; relevance, inturn, depends on the
performance measure. Fullyobservable environments areconvenient because theagentneed
notmaintainanyinternal statetokeeptrackoftheworld. An environment mightbepartially
observable because of noisy and inaccurate sensors or because parts of the state are simply
missing from the sensor data for example, a vacuum agent with only a local dirt sensor
cannottellwhetherthereisdirtinothersquares,andanautomatedtaxicannotseewhatother
drivers are thinking. If the agent has no sensors at all then the environment is unobserv-
able. One might think that in such cases the agent s plight is hopeless, but, as wediscuss in
