Thus a child of age 4 belongs only 50% to the fuzzy set child while when he is 10 years he is a 100% member. Note that membership is different from probabilities. Memberships do not necessarily add up to-1. The entries in the table have been made after a manual evaluation of the different ages. 22.4 SOME FUZZY TERMINOLOGY Now that you have a notion of fuzziness we could define some terms based on a Universal set U. Fuzzy Logic Systems 447 Au re REONNNUNENEA LARNER NRE RSENALANE TO Universe of Discourse (U): This is defined as the range of all possible values that comprise the input to the fuzzy system. Fuzzy Set Any sct that empowers its members to have different grades of membership (based on a membership function) in an interval [0,1] is a fuzzy set. Membership function The membership function yz, which forms the basis of a fuzzy set is given by ua U > [0,1] where the closed interval is one that holds real numbers. Support of a fuzzy set (S;) The support S of a fuzzy set f, in a universal crisp set U is that set which contains all elements of the set U that have a non-zero membership value in f. For instance, the support of the fuzzy set adult is Saduit = (21.30.35,40.45,60,70} Depiction of a fuzzy set A fuzzy set fin a universal crisp set U. is written as fa py ls) + py fsy + yg isa... tu, /s, where 1; is the membership and s; is the corresponding term in the support set of f i.e. Sy. This is however only a representation and has no algebraic implication (the slash and + signs do not have any meaning). Accordingly, Old = 0.1/21 + 0.3/30 + 0.35/35 + 0.4/40 + 0.6/45 + 0.8/60 + 1/70 Fuzzy Set Operations Union: The membership func
