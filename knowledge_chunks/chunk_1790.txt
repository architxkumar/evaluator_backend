Itiseasytoseethatforward chaining issound: everyinference isessentially anappli-
cationof Modus Ponens. Forwardchaining isalsocomplete: everyentailed atomicsentence
willbederived. Theeasiest waytoseethis istoconsider the finalstate oftheinferred table
(after the algorithm reaches a fixed point where no new inferences are possible). The table
FIXEDPOINT
contains true for each symbol inferred during the process, and false for all other symbols.

is false in the model. Then a ... a must be true in the model and b must be false in
1 k
the model. But this contradicts ourassumption that the algorithm has reached a fixed point!
Wecanconclude,therefore,thatthesetofatomicsentences inferredatthefixedpointdefines
a model of the original KB. Furthermore, any atomic sentence q that is entailed by the KB
must be true in all its models and in this model in particular. Hence, every entailed atomic
sentence q mustbeinferred bythealgorithm.
