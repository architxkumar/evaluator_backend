The algorithm in Figure 4.2 halts if it reaches a plateau where the best successor has
the same value as the current state. Might it not be a good idea to keep going to allow a

answerisusuallyyes,butwemusttakecare. Ifwealwaysallowsidewaysmoveswhenthere
are no uphill moves, an infinite loop will occur whenever the algorithm reaches a flat local

sideways moves in the 8-queens problem. This raises the perc
