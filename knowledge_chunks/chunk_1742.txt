TREE The second approach is based on constructing a tree decomposition of the constraint

resulting solutions are then combined. Likemostdivide-and-conquer algorithms, this works
well if no subproblem is too large. Figure 6.13 shows a tree decomposition of the map-
coloring problem into five subproblems. A tree decomposition must satisfy the following

The first two conditions ensure that all the variables and constraints are represented in the
decomposition. Thethird condition seemsrathertechnical, butsimply reflectstheconstraint
