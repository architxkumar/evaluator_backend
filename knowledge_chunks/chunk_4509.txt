ays that when the value of speed is equal to either of those mentioned in the set then the speed is categorized as slow. This may be modified to a closed interval [0, 40] to include the complete range of values. However, when the speed crosses over to 40.1 it will be categorized as not slow (or maybe fast). Likewise 39.99 will be slow, It is thus easy to visualize that a physical system which has to apply the brakes when the speed is fast (current speed does not belong to [0, 40]) and release when otherwise, would continuously keep jerking if the speed oscillates in the interval [39, 41], a situation that could eventually cause harm and subsequent damage. In such situations, we have to think of some alternative to a crisp set definition of speed. 22.3 FUZZY SETS Fuzzy sets introduce a certain amount of vagueness to reduce complexity of comprehension. This set consists of elements that signify the degree or grade of membership to a fuzzy aspect. Membership values usually use closed intervals and denote the sense of belonging of a member of a crisp set to a fuzzy set. To make the point clear consider a crisp set A comprising of elements that signify the ages of a set of people in years. A = {2,4,10,15,21,30,35,40,45,60,70} We could classify age in terms of what are known as fuzzy linguistic variables infant, child, adolescent, adult, young and old. A person whose age is 15 is no doubt young but how would you categorize a person who is 30. If the latter is to be considered young what about the person who is 40? Is he old? How do we translate all these into numbers for efficiently making the computer understand what our feelings about age are? Inspect the Table 22.1 giving ages and theit membership to a particular set. Table 22.1.
