A number of successful applications had been completed by then and they proved to he cost effective. An example which illustrates this point well is the diagnostic s stem developed by the Campbell Soup Company. Campbell Soup uses large sterilizers or cookers to cook soups and other canned 330 Expert Systems Architectures Chap. 15 products at eight plants located throughout the country.
