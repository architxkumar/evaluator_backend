There have been many attempts to write formal grammars of natural languages, both
in pure linguistics and in computational linguistics. There are several comprehensive but
informalgrammarsof English(Quirk etal.,1985;Mc Cawley,1988;Huddlestonand Pullum,
2002). Since the mid-1980s, there has been a trend toward putting more information in the
lexicon and less in the grammar. Lexical-functional grammar, or LFG (Bresnan, 1982) was
the first major grammar formalism to be highly lexicalized. If we carry lexicalization to an
extreme, weendupwith categorial grammar (Clarkand Curran, 2004), inwhichthere can
be as few as two grammar rules, or with dependency grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2008;
Ku bleretal.,2009)inwhichtherearenosyntacticcategories, onlyrelationsbetweenwords.
Sleator and Temperley (1993) describe a dependency parser. Paskin (2001) shows that a

The first computerized parsing algorithms were demonstrated by Yngve (1955). Ef-
ficient algorithms were developed in the late 1960s, with a few twists since then (Kasami,
1965;Younger, 1967;Earley,1970;Graham etal.,1980). Maxwelland Kaplan(1993)show
how chart parsing with augmentations can be made efficient in the average case. Church
and Patil (1982) address the resolution of syntactic ambiguity. Klein and Manning (2003) describe A parsing, and Pauls and Klein (2009) extend that to K-best A parsing, in which

Leading parsers today include those by Petrov and Klein (2007b), which achieved
90.6 accuracy on the Wall Street Journal corpus, Charniak and Johnson (2005), which
achieved 92.0 , and Kooet al. (2008), which achieved 93.2 on the Penn treebank. These
