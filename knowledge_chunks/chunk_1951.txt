GOAL
precondition: aconjunction ofliterals (positive ornegative) thatmaycontain variables, such
as At(p,SFO) Plane(p). Anyvariables aretreatedasexistentially quantified, sothisgoal
is to have any plane at SFO. The problem is solved when wecan find a sequence of actions
thatendinastatesthatentailsthegoal. Forexample,thestate Rich Famous Miserable
entails the goal Rich Famous, and the state Plane(Plane ) At(Plane ,SFO) entails

thegoal At(p,SFO) Plane(p).
Nowwehavedefinedplanningasasearchproblem: wehaveaninitialstate,an ACTIONS
function, a RESULT function, and a goal test. We ll look at some example problems before
investigating efficientsearchalgorithms.
10.1.1 Example: Aircargo transport
Figure10.1showsanaircargotransport problem involving loading andunloading cargoand
flyingitfrom placetoplace. Theproblem canbedefined withthree actions: Load,Unload,
and Fly. Theactions affecttwopredicates: In(c,p)meansthatcargo cisinsideplanep,and
At(x,a)meansthatobjectx(eitherplaneorcargo)isatairport a. Notethatsomecaremust
be taken to make sure the At predicates are maintained properly. When a plane flies from
oneairporttoanother, allthecargo insidetheplane goeswithit. Infirst-orderlogicitwould
beeasytoquantify overallobjects thatareinside theplane. Butbasic PDDL doesnothave
a universal quantifier, so we need a different solution. The approach we use is to say that a
pieceofcargoceasestobe Atanywherewhenitis Inaplane;thecargoonlybecomes Atthe
new airport when it is unloaded. So At really means available for use at a given location. Thefollowingplanisasolution totheproblem: Load(C ,P ,SFO),Fly(P ,SFO,JFK),Unload(C ,P ,JFK),

Finally, there is the problem ofspurious actions such as Fly(P ,JFK,JFK), which should

beano-op, butwhich hascontradictory effects (according tothedefinition, theeffect would
include At(P ,JFK) At(P ,JFK)). It is
