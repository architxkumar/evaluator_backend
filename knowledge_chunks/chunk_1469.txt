First, what isthe performance measure towhich wewould like ourautomated driver
toaspire? Desirablequalities includegetting tothecorrect destination; minimizingfuelcon-

Next, what is the driving environment that the taxi will face? Any taxi driver must
deal with a variety of roads, ranging from rural lanes and urban alleys to 12-lane freeways.
The roads contain other traffic, pedestrians, stray animals, road works, police cars, puddles,
