ies with equal rank. Norvig (1988) discusses the problems of considering multiple
simultaneous interpretations, rather than settling for a single maximum-likelihood interpre-
tation. Literary critics (Empson, 1953; Hobbs, 1990) have been ambiguous about whether

The first important result on grammar induction was a negative one: Gold (1967)
showed that it is not possible to reliably learn a correct context-free grammar, given a set of
strings fromthatgrammar. Prominentlinguists, suchas Chomsky(1957) and Pinker(2003),
UNIVERSAL have used Gold s result to argue that there must be an innate universal grammar that all
GRAMMAR
children have from birth. The so-called Poverty of the Stimulus argument says that children
aren t given enough input tolearn a CFG,so theymust already know the grammarand be
