Work by Sewall Wright (1931) on the concept of a fitness landscape was an impor-
tant precursor to the development of genetic algorithms. In the 1950s, several statisticians,
including Box (1957) and Friedman (1959), used evolutionary techniques for optimization

John Holland (1975) championed genetic algorithms, both as a useful tool and as a method
toexpand ourunderstanding ofadaptation, biological orotherwise (Holland, 1995). Thear-
tificial life movement (Langton, 1995) takes this idea one step further, viewing the products

Mostcomparisons ofgenetic algorithms tootherapproaches (especially stochastic hill
climbing) have found that the genetic algorithms are slower to converge (O Reilly and Op-
pacher,1994;Mitchelletal.,1996;Juelsand Wattenberg,1996;Baluja,1997). Suchfindings
are not universally popular within the GA community, but recent attempts within that com-
munity to understand population-based search as an appr
