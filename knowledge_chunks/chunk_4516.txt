This results in a region (area) on the output surface. For cases where an OR relates the premises the maximum membership is taken to work out the output surface. All output surfaces are found to obtain the composite output region. Depending on the application, either the Centre of Gravity or the Composite Maxima of this region (area) is found and treated as the crisp output. The former method works best for contro) applications such as the one described herein. The crisp output is the desired flow rate (X-coordinate of the Centroid) and the motorized pump is adjusted accordingly based on this value. Fuzzy Logic Systems 453 SASSER HP POON AURORE ESADGLO TEST TREA We have thus seen that the steps involved in realizing a fuzzy logic based system include - (@) Formulating Fuzzy regions, (ii) Fuzzy Rules and (iii) Embedding a Defuzzification procedure. Fuzzy Jogic has also been widely applied to non-control applications as well. Ta
