CHASTIC Fortunately, there isa more useful generalization called stochastic dominance, which
DOMINANCE
occurs very frequently in real problems. Stochastic dominance is easiest to understand in
thecontextofasingleattribute. Supposewebelievethatthecostofsitingtheairportat S is

uniformlydistributedbetween 2.8billionand 4.8billionandthatthecostat S isuniformly
2
distributedbetween 3billionand 5.2billion. Figure16.5(a)showsthesedistributions, with
cost plotted asanegative value. Then, given only the information that utility decreases with
