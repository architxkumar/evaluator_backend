g justification is added to the ATMS. Ny A No A... A Ny AD No Given the above extension to the ATMS, one can extend the GDE to handle fault models of components. In a system named GDE , Struss and Dressler (1989) show that the knowledge of behaviour of components in faulty modes can be exploited to exonerate certain components. Given a component C, if the assumption of all its fault modes is inconsistent with the observed behaviour then that component can be said to be working correctly. Consequently, it cannot be part of a candidate diagnosis, and any candidate that includes C can be discarded. Consider a component C whose observed behaviour is inconsistent with all its fault modes. An example of such a component is the bulb Bg in Figure 17.16 which is lit, while its only fault mode says that if it is faulty, it cannot be lit. Let us assume that the component C has M fault modes 70k,(C), 70k2(C), ..., 70k, (C) . Further, let us assume that it is connected or related to components A and B, which have P and Q fault modes, respectively 70k,(A), 70k2(A), ..., 70kp(A) and 70k,(B), 70k2(B), ..., 70K (B) . In addition, they all have the OK modes ok(A), ok(B), and ok(C). GDE creates the corresponding nodes in the extended ATMS. For each fault mode, it adds both the assumptions 70k(component) and ok component) along with the nodes OK component) and OKcomponent). Likewise, for the general descriptions ok(component) and 70k(component). Let us say that the given set of observations O is inconsistent with every faulty mode of the component C. This could happen if the fault modes assumptions are inconsistent with all modes, correct and faulty, of the related components, with respect to the observations O. Consider a particular fault mode ok C). This means that, VasmA -ok,(A), 7ok,(A), ..., tokp(A), ok(A) VasmB -ok,(B), ok,(B), ..., okg(B), ok(B) -ok,(C), asmA, asmB is a nogood. That is, the following sets of assumptions are nogoods. -0k,(C), ok,(4), ok,(B) cok C), 70k, (A), okg(
