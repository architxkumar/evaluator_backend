Given a source of random sentences, we can measure the probability of satisfiability.
Figure 7.19(a) plots the probability for CNF (m,50), that is, sentences with 50 variables
3
and 3 literals per clause, as a function of the clause symbol ratio, m n. As we expect, for
small m n the probability of satisfiability is close to 1, and at large m n the probability
is close to 0. The probability drops fairly sharply around m n 4.3. Empirically, we find
that the cliff stays in roughly the same place (for k 3)and gets sharper and sharper as n
SATISFIABILITY increases. Theoretically, the satisfiability threshold conjecture says that for every k 3,

thereisathreshold ratio r suchthat,asngoestoinfinity,theprobability that CNF (n,rn)

is satisfiable becomes 1 for all values of r below the threshold, and 0 for all values above.

Nowthatwehaveagood ideawherethesatisfiable andunsatisfiable problems are, the
next question is, where are the hard problems? It turns out that they are also often at the
threshold value. Figure7.19(b) showsthat 50-symbol problems atthe threshold value of4.3
are about 20 times more difficult to solve than those at a ratio of 3.3. The underconstrained
problems are easiest to solve (because it is so easy to guess a solution); the overconstrained
problemsar
