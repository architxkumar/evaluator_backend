istributions on those subsets. For example, the full joint distribution on the outcome of n
independent coin flips, P(C ,...,C ), has 2n entries, but it can be represented as the prod-
1 n
uct of n single-variable distributions P(C ). In a more practical vein, the independence of

separation of entire sets of variables by independence is quite rare. Whenever a connection,
however indirect, exists between two variables, independence will fail to hold. Moreover,

This equation is known as Bayes rule (also Bayes law or Bayes theorem). This simple

Themore general case of Bayes rule formultivalued variables can bewritten in the P
notation asfollows:

13.5.1 Applying Bayes rule: The simplecase
On the surface, Bayes rule does not seem very useful. It allows us to compute the single
term P(b a) in terms of three terms: P(a b), P(b), and P(a). That see
