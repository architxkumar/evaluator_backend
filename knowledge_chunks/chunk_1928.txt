Given these sentences, a standard inference procedure such as resolution can perform tasks
requiringequalityreasoning,suchassolvingmathematicalequations. However,theseaxioms
will generate a lot of conclusions, most of them not helpful to a proof. So there has been a
search formoreefficientwaysofhandling equality. Onealternative istoadd inference rules
rather than axioms. The simplest rule, demodulation, takes a unit clause x y and some
clause that contains the term x, and yields a new clause formed by substituting y for x
within . It works if the term within unifies with x; it need not be exactly equal to x.
Notethat demodulation isdirectional; given x y,thexalways getsreplaced withy,never
vice versa. That means that demodulation can be used for simplifying expressions using
demodulators suchasx 0 xorx1 x. Asanotherexample, given
Father(Father(x)) Paternal Grandfather(x)
Birthdate(Father(Father(Bella)),1926)
wecanconclude bydemodulation
Birthdate(Paternal Grandfather(Bella),1926).
