d describing the KS that should be activated and the specific event that fired the trigger. This latter information can be used to focus the attention of the KS when it is actually activated. Of course, a single event, such as the addition of a particular kind of hypothesis to the blackboard, could cause several triggers to fire at once, causing several activation records to be created. The KS that caused the triggering event to occur need not know about any of these subsequent activations. The actual determination of which KS should be activated next is done by a special KS, called the scheduler, on the basis of its knowledge about how best to conduct the search in the particular domain. The scheduler uses ratings supplied to it by each of the independent KSs. If the scheduler ever discovers that there are no activation records pending, then the system s execution terminates. For more information on the HEARSAY-II scheduler, see Hayes-Roth and Lesser [1977]. The techniques developed in HEARSAY-II have since been generalized in several multipurpose blackboard systems, including HEARSAY-II [Balzer et al., 1980; Erman e ai., 1981], GBB [Corkill et ai., 1987], and BB1 [Hayes-Roth, 1985; Hayes-Roth and Hewett, 1989]. For example, the use of time as an explicit dimension on the blackboard is not appropriate in all domains, so it has been removed from these more general systems. 3 Of course, demons usually are not actually implemented as processes that watch for things, but rather the things they are watching for are set up to activate them when appropriate.
