 later attributed to one Max Bezzel. It was republished in 1850
and at that time drew the attention of the eminent mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who

attempted to enumerate all possible solutions; initially he found only 72, but eventually he
found the correct answer of 92, although Nauck published all 92 solutions first, in 1850.

Each of the real-world search problems listed in the chapter has been the subject of a

pricing and restrictions have become so convoluted that the problem of selecting an optimal
flight is formally undecidable. The traveling-salesperson problem is a standard combinato-
rial problem in theoretical computer science (Lawler et al., 1992). Karp (1972) proved the
TS Pto be NP-hard, but effective heuristic approximation methods were developed (Lin and
Kernighan, 1973). Arora (1998) devised a fully polynomial approximation scheme for Eu-
clidean TS Ps. VLS Ilayout methods are surveyed by Shahookar and Mazumder (1991), and

first search was formulated for solving mazes by Moore (1959). The method of dynamic
programming (Bellman, 1957; Bellman and Dreyfus, 1962), which systematically records
solutions for all subproblems of increasing lengths, can be seen as a form of breadth-first
search on graphs. The two-point shortest-path algorithm of Dijkstra (1959) is the origin
of uniform-cost search. These works also introduced the idea of explored and frontier sets
