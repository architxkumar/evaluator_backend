4.7 In Section 4.4.1 we introduced belief states to solve sensorless search problems. A
sequence of actions solves a sensorless problem if it maps every physical state in the initial beliefstatebtoagoalstate. Supposetheagentknowsh (s),thetrueoptimalcostofsolving

4.9 On page 139 it was assumed that a given action would have the same cost when ex-
ecuted in any physical state within a given belief state. (This leads to a belief-state search
problem with well-defined step costs.) Now consider what happens when the assumption
doesnothold. Doesthenotionofoptimalitystillmakesenseinthiscontext,ordoesitrequire
