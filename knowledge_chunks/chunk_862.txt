ance graph supports the conclusion AX (or A 7X), if there exists an admissible path A-Ny-...-NyX (or A-Nq-...-Np 7X) in P. A path A-N,-...:Np (7)X is admissible, if every edge in it is admissible with respect to A. An edge V-(7)X is admissible in T with respect to A, if there is a positive path A-Ny:N2:...-N-V (r2 0) in the graph, and 1. each edge in A-N,:No:....N-V is admissible in T with respect to A, 2. no edge in A-Ny-No:... N-V is redundant in T with respect to A, 3. no intermediate node in A:N,-N2:....N, is a preemptor of the edge V-(7)X An admissible edge then is one that has an admissible path with no redundant edge in the path leading up to it, and its conclusion is not preempted by any node in the path. A node P in a path A....-P-....V is a preemptor of V-X with respect to A, if P-3X belongs to the graph I. Likewise, P is a preemptor of V-7X with respect to A if P-X is in . Essentially, a preemptor provides a shorter path to the opposite conclusion. A positive edge B-W is redundant in T with respect to A, if there is a path B-L4-Lo-...-L4-W for which, 1. each edge in B-L,-Lo:...-Ly;Wis admissible in T with respect to A, and 2. there is no C and an edge of the form C-7 L; or C- W that is admissible with respect to A in Consider the inheritance graph shown in Figure 14.22. The following edges are inadmissible w.r.t. a. Edge c-d is not admissible because it is preempted by node b. Edges f-d, f-g, g-h, e-f, a'-f, a'-e and e-g are not admissible because they do not have a positive path from a leading up to them. Note that d-h is admissible and is not preempted by c because the path to dis a-b-d. With respect to a , the following edges are inadmissible. Edge f-g is inadmissible because on the non-redundant positive path, a -e-f node e is a preemptor for g. The other path a'-f g has the redundant edge a -f. The edge g-h is inadmissible because not all edges (in particular edge f-g) on the positive nonredundant positive path to g are admissible. Edges a-b, b-c, b-
