25.7.2 Three-layer architecture
Hybrid architectures combine reaction with deliberation. The most popular hybrid architec-
THREE-LAYER ture is the three-layer architecture, which consists of a reactive layer, an executive layer,

andthedeliberative layer. Itaccepts directives bythedeliberative layer, andsequences them
for the reactive layer. For example, the executive layer might handle a set of via-points
generated by a deliberative path planner, and make decisions as to which reactive behavior
to invoke. Decision cycles at the executive layer are usually in the order of a second. The
executive layer is also responsible for integrating sensor information into an internal state
representation. Forexample,itmayhosttherobot slocalizationandonlinemappingroutines.
