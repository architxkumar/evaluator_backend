Remember that minimax search is depth-first, so at any one time we just have to con-
sider the nodes along a single path in the tree. Alpha beta pruning gets its name from the

Alpha beta search updates the values of and as it goes along and prunes the remaining
branches at a node (i.e., terminates the recursive call) as soon as the value of the current
node is known to be worse than the current or value for MAX or MIN, respectively. The
complete algorithm is given in Figure 5.7. We encourage you to trace its behavior when
appliedtothetreein Figure5.5.
