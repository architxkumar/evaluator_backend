Thus, solutions for nondeterministic problems can contain nested if then else statements;
this means that they are trees rather than sequences. This allows the selection of actions
based oncontingencies arising during execution. Manyproblems in thereal, physical world
are contingency problems because exact prediction is impossible. For this reason, many

4.3.2 AND OR searchtrees
The next question is how to find contingent solutions to nondeterministic problems. As in
Chapter3,webeginbyconstructingsearchtrees,butherethetreeshaveadifferentcharacter.
In adeterministic environment, the only branching isintroduced by the agent s ownchoices
ORNODE in each state. We call these nodes OR nodes. In the vacuum world, for example, at an OR
node the agent chooses Left or Right or Suck. In anondeterministic environment, branching
is also introduced by the environment s choice of outcome for each action. We call these
ANDNODE nodes AND nodes. For example, the Suck action in state
