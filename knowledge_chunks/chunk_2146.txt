13.4 INDEPENDENCE
Letusexpandthefulljointdistribution in Figure13.3byaddingafourthvariable, Weather.
Thefulljointdistribution thenbecomes P(Toothache,Catch,Cavity,Weather),whichhas
2 2 2 4 32 entries. It contains four editions of the table shown in Figure 13.3,
one for each kind of weather. What relationship do these editions have to each other and to
theoriginalthree-variable table? Forexample,howare P(toothache,catch,cavity,cloudy)
and P(toothache,catch,cavity)related? Wecanusetheproductrule:
P(toothache,catch,cavity,cloudy) P(cloudy toothache,catch,cavity)P(toothache,catch,cavity).
Now, unless one is in the deity business, one should not imagine that one s dental problems
influence theweather. Andforindoordentistry, atleast, it seemssafetosaythattheweather
doesnotinfluencethedentalvariables. Therefore, thefollowingassertion seemsreasonable:
P(cloudy toothache,catch,cavity) P(cloudy). (13.10)
Fromthis,wecandeduce
P(toothache,catch,cavity,cloudy) P(cloudy)
