bute A over V. moplify ename variables in each clause (disjunction). 2 end of this procedure the given first order formula is converted into an equivalent clause fo will need only a few of the above steps. As an example let us convert the following using the steps c ee FN FN EB BO EN NE OOOO FOES ODE FE ((girl(sk-y) A Vx(Aboy(x) Vv likes(x. y)) V (boy(sk-x1) A girl(sk-z) A loves(sk-x . sk Vx((girl(sk-y) A (mboy(x) V likes(x. y)) V (boy(sk-x1) A g rl(skt omloves(sk-x,. sk (girl(sk-y) V Aboy(x) V boy(sk-x,)) A (girl(sk-y) V likes(x. y) V boy(sk-x,))A (girl(sk-y) V boy(x) V girl(sk-z)) A (girl(sk-y) V likes(x. y) V girl(sk-z)) A (girl(sk-y) V aboy(x) V loves(sk-x;. sk-z)) A (girl(sk-y) V likes(x. y) V loves(sk-x. no change 10.

This does not change tt of the sentence, since each of them still represents a universally quantified variable. That is, each c o take any value. esolution Refutation in FOL th the propositional logic the procedure for finding a proof by the resolution refutation method is as fo onvert each premise into clause form 2gate the goal and convert it into clause form Jd the negated goal to the set of clauses 100se two clauses such that two opposite signed literals in them can be unified solve the two clauses using the MGU and add the resolvent to the set 2peat steps 4 5 till a null resolvent is produced ie sake of completeness the resolution rule is defined as follows. A literal is an atomic formula. A cl n of literals. Let C; and C, be two clauses with the structure, Cj (Ly V Lo VV... V Lg V Py V Po VV... V Ph) Cy (AR, V7IR2V ... VARs V Qy V Qo V... V Qh) the MGU for L, Lo, ..., L ,.R1, Ro, ..., Rs then we can
