As in game-playing, in a deterministic environment an agent just needs a preference
ranking on states the numbers don t matter. This is called a value function or ordinal

FUNCTION
It is important to remember that the existence of a utility function that describes an
agent spreferencebehaviordoesnotnecessarilymeanthat theagentisexplicitlymaximizing

be generated in any number of ways. By observing a rational agent s preferences, however,
anobservercanconstruct theutilityfunction thatrepresents whattheagentisactually trying
toachieve(eveniftheagentdoesn t knowit).
