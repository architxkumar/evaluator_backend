TS 1)) In other words, i and j cannot MEET & at different points in time, so every even] has a unique starting time. We can write a similar axiom to state that every event has a unique ending time. Next, we state that given two places where intervals meet, exactly one of the following three conditions must hold: the places are the same, the first place precedes the second, or the second precedes the first.?

Common Sense 413 ASAE RE NTR ERTL ENE There are two more axioms. One states that there are always intervals surrounding any given interval. This axiom tums out to be useful, although it prohibits any reasoning about infinite time intervals. Vi: dj, &: (7 MEETS i) A Gi MEETS &) Finally, we can state that for any two intervals that MEET, there exists a continuous interval that is the union of the two: Vi,j: (/ MEETS j) > 3a, b, +): (a MEETS i) ( (j MEETS b) A (a MEETS (i + )) A (+ j) MEETS b) These axioms encode a rich common sense theory of time. They allow us to derive many facts, such as the transitivity of the IS-BEFORE relation. Suppose we know that a IS-BEFORE b and that b IS-BEFORE c. By the definition of IS-BEFORE, there must be some interval d that lies between a and 6, i.e., a MEETS d and d MEETS b. By the union axiom, we can deduce the existence of an interval (d + b) such that there is an x that MEETS (d + ) and a y that IS-MET-BY (d + 5). By the uniqueness of starting points, we can conclude that a also meets (d+5). Since b IS-BEFORE c, there must be an e between them. We can now construct another union interval (d + b + e), which we can prove MEETS c and IS-MET-BY a. Therefore a IS-BEFORE c. This may seem like a roundabout way of doing things, and it is. There is nothing in the axioms themselves that dictates ho
