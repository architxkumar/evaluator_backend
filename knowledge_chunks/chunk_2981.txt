We can expect that medium-level successes in AI would affect all kinds of people in
theirdaily lives. Sofar, computerized communication networks, such ascell phones and the

Wecan imagine that truly useful personal assistants forthe office orthe home would have a
large positive impact on people s lives, although they might cause some economic disloca-
tion in the short term. Automated assistants fordriving could prevent accidents, saving tens
of thousands of lives per year. A technological capability at this level might also be applied
to the development of autonomous weapons, which many view as undesirable. Some of the
