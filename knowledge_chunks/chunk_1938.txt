equational solver (Schulz, 2004) have also proven to be valuable tools for proving correct-
ness. Theorem provers have been used to automatically synthesize and verify software for
controlling spacecraft (Denney et al., 2006), including NASA s new Orion capsule (Lowry,
2008). Thedesign ofthe FM9001 32-bit microprocessor wasproved correct bythe NQTHM

strength of 15 mathematical provers. TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers)
is a library of theorem-proving problems, useful for comparing the performance of systems
(Sutcliffeand Suttner,1998;Sutcliffe etal.,2006).
Theorem provers have come up with novel mathematical results that eluded human
mathematicians for decades, as detailed in the book Automated Reasoning and the Discov-
ery of Missing Elegant Proofs (Wos and Pieper, 2003). The SAM (Semi-Automated Math-
ematics) program was the first, proving a lemma in lattice theory (Guard et al., 1969). The
AURA program has also answered open questions in several areas of mathematics (Wos and
Winker, 1983). The Boyer Moore theorem prover (Boyer and Moore, 1979) was used by
Natarajan Shankar to give the first fully rigorous formal proof of Go del s Incompleteness
