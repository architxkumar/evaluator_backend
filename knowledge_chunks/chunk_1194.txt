mum belief one has in the set. The other P(A), or plausibility of A, defines the maximum possible belief in the set A. The resulting interval Bel(A), P(A) is defined as the confidence interval. For a consistent set of beliefs Bel(A) P(A). The plausibility of A, P(A) is defined as, P(A) 1 Bel(A ) where A is the complement of set A with respect to . The confidence intervals for the four sets in our example are given below. Recall that the belief in a set is the sum of belief mass of all its subsets. Bel( Urvi ) m,,( Urvi ) 0.48 P( Urvi ) 1 Bel( Aditi, Amala, Kopal ) 1-0 1 The confidence interval for Urvi is 0.48, 1.0 , saying that the minimum belief in the hypothesis is 0.48 and the maximum possible belief is 1.0. Likewise, Bel( Aditi, Urvi ) m,( Aditi, Urvi ) m,9( Urvi ) 0.12 0.48 0.6 P( Aditi, Urvi ) 1 - Bel( Amala, Kopal ) 1-0 1 Bel( Amala. Urvi ) m,,( Amala. Urvi ) m,)( Urvi ) 0.32 0.48 0.8 P( Amala, Urvi ) 1 - Bel( Aditi, Kopal ) 1-0 1 Bel(Q) m, ( Aditi, Urvi ) m)( Urvi ) m,( Amala, Urvi ) m,(O) 0.12 0.48 0.32 0.08 1.0 P() 1-Bel( ) 1-0 1 Observe that the overall beliefs in the two sets for which evidence was received Aditi, Urvi and Amala, Urvi remained unchanged after combining the two evidences. Let us compare this to reasoning with logic, with the assumption that the statements are hundred percent true. The problem could be stated as, Cartoonist(Aditi) v Cartoonist(Amala) v Cartoonist(Kopal) v Cartoonist(Urvi) Cartoonist(Aditi) v Cartoonist(Urvi) Cartoonist(Amala) v Cartoonist(Urvi) VWxVy(Cartoonist(x) A x y D Cartoonist(y)) Then the only conclusion that one can draw is that Urvi is the one who put up the cartoon. Given that the statements are not a hundred percent true and one has a partial belief in each, the D-S theory results in a partial belief in the same statement. Observe that Urvi is the only singleton set (which satisfies the mutual exclusion property) that has positive belief. Now consider the third piece of evidence that comes in the points to the
