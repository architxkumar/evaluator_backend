er bank teading. This requirement can even cause a later sentence to impose a constraint on the interpretation of an earlier one, as in the discourse, I went down to the bank. The river had just flooded, and I wanted to see how bad things were. And finally, pragmatic processing contributes yet another set of constraints. For example, The meaning of the sentence must be consistent with the known goals of the speaker. So, for example, in the sentence, Mary was anxious to get the bill passed this session, so she moved to table it, we are forced to choose the (normally British) meaning of table (to put it on the table for discussion) over the (normally American) meaning (to set it aside for later). There are many important issues in natural language processing that we have barely touched on here. To learn more about the overall problem, see Allen [1987], Cullingford [1986], Dowty er a/. [1985],and Grosz et al. [1986]. For more information on syntactic processing, see Winograd [1983] and King [1983]. See Joshi et al. [1981] for more discussion of the issues involved in discourse understanding. Also, we have restricted our discussion to natural language understanding. It is often useful to be able to go the other way as well, that is, to begin with a logical description and render it into English. For discussions of natural language generation systems, see Mc Keown and Swartout [1987] and Mc Donald and Bole [1988]. By combining understanding and generation systems, it is possible to attack the problem of machine translation, by which we understand text written in one language and then generate it in another language. See Slocum [1988], Nirenburg [1987], Lehrberger and Bourbeau [1988], and Nagao [1989] for discussions of a variety of approaches to this problem. We have also seen how statistical methods come to the aid of natural language processing. The use of a large corpus and the frequency and sequence of occurrence of words can be used to decide and predict the correct
