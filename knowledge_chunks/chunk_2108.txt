2006) and RD Fa (Adida and Birbeck, 2008), which use HTML and XHTML markup to
add attributes to literal text. Usage of sophisticated RDF and OWL ontologies is not yet
widespread, and the full vision of the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al., 2001) has not yet
been realized. The conferences on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS)contain
manyinteresting papersonbothgeneralanddomain-specific ontologies.
The taxonomy used in this chapter was developed by the authors and is based in part
on their experience in the CYC project and in part on work by Hwang and Schubert (1993)
and Davis (1990, 2005). An inspirational discussion of the general project of commonsense
knowledgerepresentation appearsin Hayes s(1978, 1985b) Naive Physics Manifesto. Successful deep ontologies within a specific field include the Gene Ontology project
(Consortium, 2008)and CML,the Chemical Markup Language(Murray-Rust etal.,2003).
470 Chapter 12. Knowledge Representation
Doubts about the feasibility of a single ontology for all knowledge are expressed by
Doctorow (2001), Gruber (2004), Halevy et al. (2009), and Smith (2004), who states, the
