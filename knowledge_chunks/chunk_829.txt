 create representations of such knowledge structures, called Scripts. Retrieving and using an appropriate Script makes the task of story understanding a feasible one. We look at Scripts and other related knowledge structures after the following section.

One can think of other relations between different concepts and individuals. An extension of relations leads us to a more general idea of a semantic net. A semantic net is essentially a graphical form of knowledge representation composed with binary relations or triples. Each edge in a node represents a particular relation between the nodes. Figure 14.8 shows a semantic network that has more elements and relations added to Figure 12.15. The idea is that such a graphical representation of knowledge will facilitate the discovery of how two elements are related. The method of activation spreading was proposed in Ross Quillian s work (Quillian, 1966). Consider the family network depicted in Figure 12.15. It is a semantic network with two kinds of relations, father-child and motherchild. On this network, we can ask the following question How is Arushi related to Aeden? One can employ a two-way marker passing algorithm with activation sp
