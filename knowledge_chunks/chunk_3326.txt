 form of the generalized modes ponens reads Premise: xis Al Implication: If x is A then y is B Conclusion: y is B I An example of this form of modus ponens is given as Premise: This banana is very yellow Implication: If a banana is yellow then the banana is ripe Conclusion: This banana is very ripe Although different forms of fuzzy inference have been proposed, we present only Zadeh's original compositional rule of inference. First, recall the definition of a relation. For two Sets A and B, the Cartesian product A )( B is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b), for a C A and b B. A binary relation on two sets A and B is a subset of A x B. Likewise, we define a binary fuzzy relation R as a subset of the fuzzy Cartesian product A X B, a mapping of A - B characterized by the two parameter membership function u R(a.b). For example, let A = B R the set of real numbers, and let R: = much larger than. A membership function for this relation might then be defined as (0 for a UR(a.b) =0 1(1 + (a - b2' fora > b p.. 102 Dealing with Inconsistencies and Uncertainties Chap. 5 Now let X and I be two universes and let Aand 11 be fuzzy sets in X and X x Y respectively. Define fuzzy relations RA(x). R8(x,y), and R(y) in X, X X Y and Y, respectively. T hen the compositional rule of inference is th solution of the relational equation 'c(Y) = RA(x) o R9(x,y) = max, min{u(4,u8(x,y)1 where the symbol o signifies the composition of A and A. As an example, let X = y={l,2,3,4} A = {little} = {( I / 1),(2 / .6),(3 / .2),(4 I 0) R approximately equal, a fuzzy relation defined by y1234 I.I .5 0 0 : 2 .5 I .5 0 X 3 0 .5 I .5 4 00.511 Then applying the-max-min composition rule = max, rain (UA(x),UR(X.y)) = max, {min[( I, minl(I..5),(.6.l),(.2,.5)0.0)1. mm ((l,0),(.6,.5),(.2,1),(0,.5)1. min[( I ,0),(.6,0),(.2,.5).(0, 1))) = max,{(1,.5,0,01,(.5,.6,.2,0],(O..5,.2,01.(0,0..2,0]} = {( 11,1.61,1 .51,E.21} Therefore the solution is = {(l /1),(2 /.6),(3 /.5),(4/.2)}. Stated in terms of a fuzzy modus ponens,
