Continuing the example from the previous section, suppose that webelieve that Richard has
twobrothers, Johnand Geoffrey.8 Canwecapturethisstateofaffairsbyasserting
Brother(John,Richard) Brother(Geoffrey,Richard)? (8.3)
Not quite. First, this assertion is true in a model where Richard has only one brother we need to add John (cid:7) Geoffrey. Second, the sentence doesn t rule out models in which
Richard has manymore brothers besides John and Geoffrey. Thus, thecorrect translation of Richard s brothersare Johnand Geoffrey isasfollows:
Brother(John,Richard) Brother(Geoffrey,Richard) John (cid:7) Geoffrey x Brother(x,Richard) (x John x Geoffrey).
For many purposes, this seems muc
