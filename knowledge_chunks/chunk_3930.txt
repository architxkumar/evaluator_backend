 /\ 7b], and the standard correspondences between quantifiers [AV : P(x) = dx: a P(x) and 73x: P(x) = Vx : a P()]. Performing this transformation on the wff from step 1 yields Vx : [>Roman(x) \/ ~know(x, Marcus)} \V/ [Aate(x, Caesar) \/ (Vy : Vz : shately, z) VV thinkcrazy(x, y))] 3. Standardize variables so that each quantifier binds a unique variable. Since variables are just dummy names, this process cannot affect the truth value of the wff. For example, the formula Wx: Pix Vy Vx: OG) would be converted to Was PQ) VY Vy: 06) This step is in preparation for the next. 4. Move all quantifiers to the left of the formula without changing their relative order. This is possible since there is no conflict among variable names. Performing this operation on the formula of step 2, we get Wx: Vy: z: [>Roman(x) \V aknow(x Marcus)| VV {hate(x, Caesar) \/ (shate(y, z) \/ thinkerazy(x.y))] At this point, the formula is in what is known as prenex normal form. It consists of a prefix of quantifiers followed by a matrix, which is quantifier-free. 5. Eliminate existential quantifiers. A formula that contains an existentially quantified variahle asserts that there is a value that can be substituted for the variable that makes the formula true. We can eliminate the quantifier by substituting for the variable a reference to a function that produces the desired value. Since we do not necessarily know how to produce the value, we must create a new function name for every such replacement. We make no assertions about these functions except that they must exist. So, for example, the formula dy : President(y) can be transformed into the formula President(S1) Using Predicate Logic 111 aes pp TEA HORNA Pe where SI is a function with no arguments that somehow produces a value that satisfies President. Tf existential quantifiers occur within the scope of universal quantifiers, then the value that satisfies the predicate may depend on the values of the universally quantified variables. For examp
