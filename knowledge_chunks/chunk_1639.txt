The belief-state approach was reinvented in the context of sensorless and partially ob-
servable searchproblems by Genesereth and Nourbakhsh (1993). Additional workwasdone
onsensorless problems inthe logic-based planning community (Goldman and Boddy, 1996;
Smithand Weld, 1998). Thiswork has emphasized concise representations forbelief states,

for belief-state search; these were refined by Bryce et al. (2006). The incremental approach
to belief-state search, in which solutions are constructed incrementally for subsets of states
withineachbeliefstate,wasstudiedintheplanningliteratureby Kurienetal.(2002);several
newincrementalalgorithms wereintroduced fornondeterministic, partiallyobservable prob-
lemsby Russelland Wolfe(2005). Additional references for planning instochastic, partially
observable environments appearin Chapter17.
