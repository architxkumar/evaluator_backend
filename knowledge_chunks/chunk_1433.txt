the show. Although the others had ideas and in some cases programs for particular appli-
cations such as checkers, Newell and Simon already had a reasoning program, the Logic
Theorist (LT), about which Simonclaimed, Wehave invented acomputerprogram capable

The Dartmouth workshop did not lead to any new breakthroughs, but it did introduce
all the major figures to each other. For the next 20 years, the field would be dominated by
thesepeopleandtheirstudents andcolleagues at MIT,CMU,Stanford, and IBM.
Looking at the proposal for the Dartmouth workshop (Mc Carthy et al., 1955), we can
see whyitwasnecessary for AIto become aseparate field. Whycouldn t all the workdone
in AI have taken place under the name of control theory or operations research or decision
theory, which, after all, have objectiv
