B.2 DESCRIBING ALGORITHMS WITH PSEUDOCODE
Thealgorithms inthisbookaredescribed inpseudocode. Mostofthepseudocode should be
familiar to users of languages like Java, C , or Lisp. In some places we use mathematical

persistent variables are like global variables in that they outlive a single call to their
function, but they are accessible only within the function. The agent programs in the
book use persistent variables for memory. Programs with persistent variables can be
implemented as objects in object-oriented languages such as C , Java, Python, and
Smalltalk. In functional languages, they can be implemented by functional cl
