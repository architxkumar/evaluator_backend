g. 8.1(b), we need to consider our belief in a collection of several propositions taken together. In Fig. 8.1(c), the output of one rule provides the input to another. What formulas should be used to perform these combinations? Before we answer that question, we need first to describe some properties that we would like th combining functions to satisfy: Fig. 8.1 Combining Uncertain Rules * Since the order in which evidence is collected is arbitrary, the combining functions should be commutative and associative. Until certainty is reached, additional confirming evidence should increase MB (and similarly for disconfirming evidence and MD). If uncertain inferences are chained together, then the result should be less certain than either of the inferences alone. Having accepted the desirability of these properties, let s first consider the scenario in Fig. 8.1(a), in which several pieces of evidence are combined to determine the CF of one hypothesis. The measures of belief and disbelief of a hypothesis given two observations s, and s, are computed from: voter prema enema 176 Artificial Intelligence AEA.

Otherwise, the measure of belief in # given two observations is the measure of belief given only one observation plus some increment for the second observation. This increment is computed by first taking the difference between | (certainty) and the belief given only the first observation, This difference is the most that can be added by the second ohservation. The difference is then scaled by the belief in 4 given only the second observation. A corresponding explanation can be given, then, for the formula for computing disbelief. From MB and MD, CF can be com
