collection of agents, each of which controls a subset of the constraint variables. There have
been annual workshops on this problem since 2000, and good coverage elsewhere (Collin
etal.,1999;Pearceetal.,2008;Shohamand Leyton-Brown,2009).

that one algorithm dominates another on all problems; instead, we need to run experiments
to see which algorithms perform better on typical instances of problems. As Hooker (1995)
points out, we need to be careful to distinguish between competitive testing as occurs in
competitions among algorithms based on run time and scientific testing, whose goal is to
identify theproperties ofanalgorithm thatdetermineitsefficacyonaclassofproblems.
The recent textbooks by Apt (2003) and Dechter (2003), and the collection by Rossi
etal. (2006) are excellent resources on constraint processing. There are several good earlier
surveys,includingthoseby Kumar(1992),Dechterand Frost(2002),and Bartak(2001);and
the encyclopedia articles by Dechter (1992) and Mackworth (1992). Pearson and Jeavons
(1997) survey tractable classes of CS Ps, covering both structural decomposition methods
and methods that rely on properties of the domains or constraints themselves. Kondrak and
van Beek (1997) give an analytical survey of backtracking search algorithms, and Bacchus
andvan Run(1995) giveamoreempirical survey. Constraint programming iscoveredinthe

The primary conference venue is the International Conference on Principles and Practice of
Constraint Programming,oftencalled CP.
