and b are zero, the flow-rate equals the constant which makes this rule similar to the previous one.) This value of flow rate (flow-rate) may he weighted using the firing strength (memberships) of the inputs to give the actual flow rate as given below: N x wifi =) Actual flow rate F= y dw, 4=] where N is the number of rules triggered and the weight w; = min(z,); j= 1 to 44 the number of sensor inputs.

For instance the fuzzy set slow could be further augmented by a word very to make very slow. Words like these (very, definitely, rather, etc.) are termed as Fuzzy Hedges and are used to modify the shape of a fuzzy set. The modification is achieved by altering the membership function. Table 22.2 lists some hedges and their equivalent meanings. These hedges can help define new contours of control allowing users to tune the system to meet the desired performance specifications. The fuzzy rules could be specified using these hedges to augment control. An instance could be ~ If the temperature is positively high and fan speed is rather low then flow-rate is very high. The terms positively, rather and very constitute the hedges that shape the behavior of the respective fuzzy sets.
