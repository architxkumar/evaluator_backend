But we do not yet know which specific individuals are being referred to. Specifically, we do not know to whom the pronoun I or the proper noun Bill refers. To pin down these references requires an appeal to a model of the current discourse context, from which we can learn that the current user (who typed the word I ) is User068 and that the only person named Bill about whom we could be talking is User073. Once the correct referent for Bill is known, we can also determine exactly which file is being referred to: F'/ is the only file with the extension init that is owned by Bill. Pragmatic Analysis We now have a complete description, in the terms provided by our knowledge base, of what was said. The final step toward effective understanding is to decide what to do as a result. One possible thing to do is to record what was said as a fact and be done with it. For some sentences, whose intended effect is clearly declarative, that is precisely the correct thing to do, But for other sentences, including this one, the intended effect is different.
