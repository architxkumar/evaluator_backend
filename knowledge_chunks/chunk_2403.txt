17.5 DECISIONS WITH MULTIPLE AGENTS: GAME THEORY
This chapter has concentrated on making decisions in uncertain environments. But what if
theuncertainty isduetootheragentsandthedecisionstheymake? Andwhatifthedecisions
of those agents are in turn influenced by our decisions? We addressed this question once
before, when westudied gamesin Chapter 5. There, however, wewereprimarily concerned
with turn-taking games in fully observable environments, for which minimax search can be
usedtofindoptimalmoves. Inthissectionwestudytheaspectsofgametheorythatanalyze
