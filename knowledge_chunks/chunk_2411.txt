his gives us a turn-
taking game to which we can apply the standard minimax algorithm from Chapter 5.
Let s suppose this gives an outcome U . Clearly, this game favors O, so the true
E,O
utility U of the original game (from E s point of view) is at least U . Forexample,
E,O
if we just look at pure strategies, the minimax game tree has a root value of 3 (see
Figure17.12(a)), soweknowthat U 3. Nowsuppose wechangetherulestoforce O torevealhisstrategyfirst,followedby E.
Thentheminimaxvalueofthisgameis U ,andbecausethisgamefavors Eweknow
O,E
that U is at most U . With pure strategies, the value is 2(see Figure 17.12(b)), so

weknow U 2.
Combining these twoarguments, wesee that thetrue utility U ofthesolution totheoriginal
