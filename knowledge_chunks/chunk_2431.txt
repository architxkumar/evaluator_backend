price auction isnottruth-revealing. Many Internet search
engines use a mechanism where they auction k slots for ads on a page. The highest bidder
wins the top spot, the second highest gets the second spot, and so on. Each winner pays the
price bid by the next-lower bidder, with the understanding that payment is made only if the
searcher actually clicks on the ad. The top slots are considered more valuable because they
are more likely to be noticed and clicked on. Imagine that three bidders, b ,b and b , have

valuations foraclick of v 200,v 180, and v 100, and thatk 2slots are available,

where it is known that the top spot is clicked on 5 of the time and the bottom spot 2 . If
all bidders bid truthfully, then b wins the top slot and pays 180, and has an expected return

mechanism for this multislot problem, in which the winner of slot j pays the full price for
slot j just for those additional clicks that are available at slot j and not at slot j 1. The
winner pays the price for the lower slot for the remaining clicks. In our example, b would

Anotherexample ofwhere auctions can come into play within AI is whenacollection
of agents are deciding whether to cooperate on a joint plan. Hunsberger and Grosz (2000)
show that this can be accomplished efficiently
