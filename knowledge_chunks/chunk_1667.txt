Forthe openings, thecomputer ismostly relying onthe expertise ofhumans. Thebest
advice ofhumanexpertsonhowtoplayeachopening iscopied frombooks andentered into
tables forthecomputer s use. However, computers canalso gatherstatistics from adatabase
of previously played games to see which opening sequences most often lead to a win. In

king s mobility bysqueezing ittowardone edgeoftheboard, using yourking toprevent the

there are 462 ways that two kings can be placed on the board without being adjacent. After
the kings are placed, there are 62 empty squares for the bishop, 61 for the knight, and two
