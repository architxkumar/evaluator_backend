19.6 SUMMARY
This chapter has investigated various ways in which prior knowledge can help an agent to
learn from new experiences. Because much prior knowledge is expressed in terms of rela-
tional models rather than attribute-based models, we have also covered systems that allow
learning ofrelational models. Theimportantpointsare: The use of prior knowledge in learning leads to a picture of cumulative learning, in
whichlearning agentsimprovetheirlearning abilityastheyacquiremoreknowledge. Priorknowledge helps learning byeliminating otherwise consistent hypotheses andby
