For tic-tac-toe the game tree is relatively small fewer than 9! 362,880 terminal
nodes. But for chess there are over 1040 nodes, so the game tree is best thought of as a
theoretical construct that we cannot realize in the physical world. But regardless of the size

5.2 OPTIMAL DECISIONS IN GAMES
In a normal search problem, the optimal solution would be a sequence of actions leading to
a goal state a terminal state that is a win. In adversarial search, MIN has something to say
STRATEGY about it. MAX therefore must find a contingent strategy, which specifies MAX s move in
the initial state, then MAX s moves in the states resulting from every possible response by
