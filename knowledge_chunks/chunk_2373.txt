Sections 17.2 and 17.3 explain how they can
be solved to produce optimal behavior that balances the risks and rewards of acting in an
uncertain environment. Section 17.4 extends these ideas to the case of partially observable
environments, and Section17.4.3developsacompletedesignfordecision-theoretic agentsin
partially observable environments, combining dynamic Bayesian networks from Chapter 15
withdecision networksfrom Chapter16.
The second part of the chapter covers environments with multiple agents. In such en-
vironments, the notion of optimal behavior is complicated by the interactions among the
agents. Section 17.5 introduces the main ideas of game theory, including the idea that ra-
tional agents might need tobehave randomly. Section 17.6looks athow multiagent systems

inthestartstate,itmustchooseanactionateachtimestep. Theinteraction withtheenviron-
ment terminates when the agent reaches one of the goal states, marked 1 or 1. Just as for
search problems, the actions available to the agent in each state are given by ACTIONS(s),
sometimes abbreviated to A(s); in the 4 3 environment, the actions in every state are Up,
Down,Left,and Right. Weassume fornowthattheenvironment is fullyobservable, sothat
