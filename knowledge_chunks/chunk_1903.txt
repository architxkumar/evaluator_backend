Irrelevant facts
The final source of inefficiency in forward chaining appears to be intrinsic to the approach
andalsoarisesinthepropositional context. Forwardchainingmakesallallowableinferences

One way to avoid drawing irrelevant conclusions is to use backward chaining, as de-
scribedin Section9.4. Anothersolutionistorestrictforwardchainingtoaselectedsubsetof
