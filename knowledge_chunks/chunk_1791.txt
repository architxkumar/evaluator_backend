The backward-chaining algorithm, as its name suggests, works backward from the
query. Ifthe query q is known to be true, then no work is needed. Otherwise, the algorithm
finds those implications inthe knowledge base whose conclusion is q. If all the premises of
one of those implications can be proved true (by backward chaining), then q is true. When
applied to the query Q in Figure 7.16, it works back downthe graph until it reaches a set of

to the AND-OR-GRAPH-SEARCH algorithm in Figure 4.11. As with forward chaining, an

7.6 EFFECTIVE PROPOSITIONAL MODEL CHECKING
In this section, we describe two families of efficient algorithms for general propositional
inference based on model checking: One approach based on backtracking search, and one
