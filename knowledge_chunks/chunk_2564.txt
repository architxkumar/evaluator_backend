Wehave defined generalization and specialization as operations that change the exten-
sion of a hypothesis. Now we need to determine exactly how they can be implemented as
syntactic operations that change the candidate definition associated with the hypothesis, so
thataprogramcancarrythemout. Thisisdonebyfirstnotingthatgeneralizationandspecial-
ization are also logical relationships between hypotheses. If hypothesis h , with definition

Therefore in order to construct a generalization of h , we simply need to find a defini-

tion C that is logically implied by C . This is easily done. For example, if C (x) is

Alternate(x) Patrons(x,Some), then one possible generalization is given by C (x) 1
DROPPING Patrons(x,Some). This is called dropping conditions. Intuitively, it generates a weaker

specialize ahypothesis byadding extra conditions toitscandidate definition orbyremoving
