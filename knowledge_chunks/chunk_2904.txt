The deliberative layer generates global solutions to complex tasks using planning.
DELIBERATIVELAYER
Because of the computational complexity involved in generating such solutions, its decision
cycleisoftenintheorderofminutes. Thedeliberative layer(orplanning layer) usesmodels
for decision making. Those models might be either learned from data or supplied and may
utilizestateinformation gathered attheexecutivelayer.
