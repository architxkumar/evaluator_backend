done in the network model but at what price in complexity. 9.1.4 Partitioned Semantic Nets Suppose we want to represent simple quantified expressions in semantic nets. One way to do this is to partition the semantic net into a hierarchical set of spaces, each of which corresponds to the scope of one or more variables [Hendrix, 1977]. To see how this works, consider first the simple net shown in Fig. 9.4(a). This net corresponds to the statement The dog bit the mail carrier The nodes Dot's, Bite, and Mail-Carrier represent the classes of dogs, bitings, and mail carriers, respectively, while the nodes d, b, and m represent a particular dog, a particular biting, and a particular mail carrier. This fact can easily be represented by a single net with no partitioning. But now suppose that we want to represent the fact Every dog has bitten a mail carrier, or, in logic: Vx: Dog(x) > Sy : Mail-Carrier (yy A Bite \ (x. y) To represent this fact, it is necessary to encode the scope of the universally quantified variable x. This can be done using partitioning as shown in Fig. 9.4(b). The node g stands for the assertion given above. Node g is an instance of the special class GS of general statements about the world (i-e., those with universal quantifiers). Every element of GS has at least two attributes: a form, which states the relation that is being asserted, and one 192 Artificial Intelligence or more V connections. one for cach of the universally quantified variables. In this example, there is only one such variable , which can stand for any element of the class Dogs. The other two variables in the form, 4 and m, are understood to be existentially quantified. In other words, for every dog d, there exists a biting event b, and a mail carrier m, such that d is the assailant of 6 and m is the victim.
