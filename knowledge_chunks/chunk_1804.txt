The solution to the problem involves changing one s focus from writing axioms about
actions towriting axioms about fluents. Thus, foreach fluent F, wewillhavean axiom that
definesthetruthvalueof Ft 1intermsoffluents(including F itself)attimetandtheactions
thatmayhaveoccurredattimet. Now,thetruthvalueof Ft 1 canbesetinoneoftwoways:

SUCCESSOR-STATE axiomandhasthisschema:

Ft 1 Action Causes Ft (Ft Action Causes Not Ft).
One of the simplest successor-state axioms is the one for Have Arrow. Because there is no
actionforreloading, the Action Causes Ft partgoesawayandweareleftwith
Have Arrowt 1 (Have Arrowt Shoott). (7.2)
For the agent s location, the successor-state axioms are more elaborate. For example, Lt 1
1,1
is true if either (a) the agent moved Forward from 1,2 when facing south, or from 2,1 whenfacingwest;or(b)Lt wasalreadytrueandtheactiondidnotcausemovement(either
1,1
because the action wasnot Forward orbecause theaction bumped into awall). Written out
inpropositional logic,thisbecomes
Lt 1 (Lt ( Forwardt Bumpt 1))
1,1 1,1 (Lt (Southt Forwardt)) (7.3)
1,2 (Lt (Westt Forwardt)).
