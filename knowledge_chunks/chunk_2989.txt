A.3 PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS
Aprobability isameasureoverasetofeventsthatsatisfiesthreeaxioms:
1. The measure of each event is between 0 and 1. Wewrite this as 0 P(X x ) 1,
i
where X is a random variable representing an event and x are the possible values of
i
X. In general, random variables are denoted by uppercase letters and their values by
lowercaseletters.

A probabilistic modelconsists of a sample space of mutually exclusive possible outcomes,

We use P(X) to denote the vector of values (cid:16)P(X x ),...,P(X x )(cid:17). We also
