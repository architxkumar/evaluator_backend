ation, by Bartlett s student and successor Kenneth
Craik (1943), forcefully reestablished the legitimacy of such mental terms as beliefs and
goals, arguing that they are just as scientific as, say, using pressure and temperature to talk
about gases, despite their being made of molecules that have neither. Craik specified the
threekeystepsofaknowledge-based agent: (1)thestimulusmustbetranslatedintoaninter-
nalrepresentation, (2)therepresentation ismanipulated bycognitiveprocessestoderivenew
internal representations, and (3) these are in turn retranslated back into action. He clearly
explained whythiswasagooddesignforanagent:

George Millerpresented The Magic Number Seven,Noam Chomskypresented Three Models
of Language, and Allen Newell and Herbert Simon presented The Logic Theory Machine.
These three influential papers showed how computer models could be used to address the
psychology of memory, language, and logical thinking, respectively. It is now a common
(although far from universal) view among psychologists that a cognitive theory should be
