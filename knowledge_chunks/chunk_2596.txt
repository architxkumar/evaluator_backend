Clearly, inverse resolution involves a search. Each inverse resolution step is nonde-
terministic, because for any C, there can be many or even an infinite number of clauses
C and C that resolve to C. For example, instead of choosing Parent(Elizabeth,y) 1 2
Grandparent(George,y) for C in the last step of Figure 19.13, the inverse resolution step
