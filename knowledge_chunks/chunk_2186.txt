Figure 14.6 The graphs in (a) and (b) show the probability distribution over Cost as a
function of Harvest size, with Subsidy true and false, respectively. Graph (c) shows the
distribution P(Cost Harvest),obtainedbysummingoverthetwosubsidycases.
and (b) show these tworelationships. Notice that in each case the slope is negative, because
cost decreases as supply increases. (Of course, the assumption of linearity implies that the
costbecomesnegativeatsomepoint;thelinearmodelisreasonableonlyiftheharvestsizeis

The linear Gaussian conditional distribution has some special properties. A network
containing only continuous variables with linear Gaussian distributions has a joint distribu-
tionthatisamultivariate Gaussiandistribution(see Appendix A)overallthevariables(Exer-
cise14.9). Furthermore,theposteriordistribution given anyevidencealsohasthisproperty.3
When discrete variables are added as parents (not as children) of continuous variables, the
CONDITIONAL network defines a conditional Gaussian, or CG, distribution: given any assignment to the
GAUSSIAN
discretevariables, thedistribution overthecontinuous variables isamultivariate Gaussian.
Now we turn to the distributions for discrete variables with continuous parents. Con-
sider, for example, the Buys node in Figure 14.5. It seems reasonable to assume that the
customer will buy if the cost is low and will not buy if it is high and that the probability of
buyingvariessmoothlyinsomeintermediateregion. Inotherwords,theconditionaldistribu-
