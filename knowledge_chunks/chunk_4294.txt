en how statistical methods come to the aid of natural language processing. The use of a large corpus and the frequency and sequence of occurrence of words can be used to decide and predict the correctness of a given text. This can also be used for language generation to a certain extent. Natural language processing also entails spell checking as a preprocessing exercise. This chapter introduced some common spelling errors, checking and suggestion generation methods. A good discussion on spell checkers can be found in Kuckich s paper entitled Techniques for Automatically Correcting Words in Text , ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 24, No. 4, December 1992, pp. 377-439.

As a tail ender one must bear in mind that once a spell checker has been designed for a language, the same checker need not always work well for another. Considerable effort may have to be put in before the realization of the same for a new language. The paper by M. Das, S.Borgohain, J.Gogoi, $.B.Nair, Design and Implementation of a Spell Checker for Assamese , Proceedings of the Language Engineering Conference, 2002, IEEE CS Press, pp.156-162, throws more insights into this aspect.
