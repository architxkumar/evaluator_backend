The idea of backtracking search goes back to Golomb and Baumert (1965), and its

the basic algorithm back to the 19th century. Bitner and Reingold also introduced the MRV
heuristic, which they called the most-constrained-variable heuristic. Brelaz (1979) used the
degree heuristic as a tiebreaker after applying the MRV heuristic. The resulting algorithm,
despite its simplicity, is still the best method for k-coloring arbitrary graphs. Haralick and
Elliot(1980)proposed theleast-constraining-value heuristic.

The basic backjumping method is due to John Gaschnig (1977, 1979). Kondrak and
van Beek (1997) showed that this algorithm is essentially subsumed by forward checking.
Conflict-directed backjumping was devised by Prosser (1993). The most general and pow-
erful form of intelligent backtracking was actually developed very early on by Stallman and

The work of Stallman and Sussman also introduced the idea of constraint learning,
in which partial results obtained by search can be saved and reused later in the search. The
