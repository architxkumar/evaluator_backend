 system must have to"comprehend" the scene portrayed in Figure 14.3. 14.3. Suppose the CPU in a vision system takes 200 nanoseconds to perform memory/ register transfers and 500 nanoseconds to perform basic arithmetic operations. Estimate the time required to produce a binary image for a system with a resolution of 256 x 256 pixels. 14.4. How much memory is required to produce and compare five different binary images, each with a different threshold level? Assume a system resolution of 512 x 512. Can the binary images be compressed in some way to reduce memory requirements? 14.5. Find the binary image for the array given below when the threshold is set at 35. 23 132 35 36 30 42 38 2 9 34 36 37 36 35 33 14.6.

Low noise systems should use little or no filtering to avoid unnecessary blurring. This means that more weight should be given to the pixel being smoothed. Define two low-noise filters, one a four-neighbor and one an eight-neighbor filter, and compare their effects on the array of Problem 14.5. 14.10. Using a value of n I, apply D and D (horizontally) to the array of Problem 14.5 and comment on the trace of any apparent edges. 14.11. Apply the vector gradient to the array of Problem 14.5 and compare the results to those of Problem 14.7. 14.12. This problem relates to the application of template matching using correlation techniques. The objective is to try to match an
