a phone as three states, the onset, middle, and end. For example, the t phone has a silent
beginning, asmallexplosive burst ofsound inthemiddle, and(usually) ahissing attheend.
Figure 23.16 shows an example for the phone m . Note that in normal speech, an average
phone has a duration of 50 100 milliseconds, or 5 10 frames. The self-loops in each state
allowsforvariation inthis duration. Bytaking manyself-loops (especially inthe midstate),
we can represent a long mmmmmmmmmmm sound. Bypassing the self-loops yields a
short m sound.

ow . Figure 23.17(a) shows a transition model that provides for this dialect variation. Each

Inaddition todialect variation, wordscan have coarticulation variation. Forexample,
the t phone is produced with the tongue at the top of the mouth, whereas the ow has the
tongue near the bottom. When speaking quickly, the tongue doesn t have time to get into
position for the ow , and we end up with t ah rather than t ow . Figure 23.17(b) gives
