c. Supposeweapply BACKTRACKING-SEARCH (page215)tofindallsolutions toa SAT
CSP of the type given in (a). (To find all solutions to a CSP, we simply modify the
basic algorithm so it continues searching after each solution is found.) Assume that
variables are ordered X ,...,X and false is ordered before true. How much time

d. We know that SAT problems in Horn form can be solved in linear time by forward
chaining (unit propagation). We also know that every tree-structured binary CSP with
discrete, finite domains can be solved in time linear in the number of variables (Sec-
tion6.5). Arethesetwofactsconnected? Discuss.
