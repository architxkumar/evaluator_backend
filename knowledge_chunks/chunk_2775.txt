we have seen, we notice that qui dort and sleeping co-occur with high frequency,
and that in the pair of aligned sentences, no phrase other than qui dort co-occurs so
frequently in other sentences with sleeping. A complete phrase alignment over our
corpusgivesusthephrasalprobabilities (afterappropriate smoothing).
5. Extract distortions: Once we have an alignment of phrases we can define distortion
probabilities. Simplycount howoften distortion occurs in thecorpus foreachdistance
