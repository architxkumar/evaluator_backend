K) 7 else if h(K) t(X) 8 then h(K) ? 9 return h FIGURE 18.8 The procedure FIND S begins with the most specific hypothesis in the hypotheses space. For every positive training example it sees for the target class, it generalizes the value of each attribute in the hypothesis, just enough to match the value of the attribute in the training instance. Given sufficient training examples, the algorithm is guaranteed to learn the target function, provided it exists in the hypothesis space H and there are no errors in the training data. Let us investigate how the algorithm fares with our example, given that we want to learn the target concept VeryHigh (salary). The training data extracted from Table 15.3 is shown in Table 18.2. The label Exp-Symb refers to Experience converted to nominal form manually, and the label Sa -Symbol likewise for Salary.
