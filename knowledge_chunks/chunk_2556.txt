18.17 Construct a support vector machine that computes the XOR function. Use values of 1 and 1 (instead of 1 and 0) for both inputs and outputs, so that an example looks like
( 1,1 ,1)or( 1, 1 , 1). Maptheinput x ,x intoaspaceconsistingofx andx x .

18.18 Consider an ensemble learning algorithm that uses simple majority voting among
K learned hypotheses. Suppose that each hypothesis has error (cid:2) and that the errors made
by each hypothesis are independent of the others . Calculate a formula for the error of the
ensemble algorithm in terms of K and (cid:2), and evaluate it for the cases where K 5, 10, and
