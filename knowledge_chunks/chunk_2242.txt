tial vacuum to be filled by alternative methods. Certainty factors were
invented foruseinthemedicalexpertsystem MYCIN (Shortliffe, 1976),whichwasintended
both as an engineering solution and as a model of human judgment under uncertainty. The
collection Rule-Based Expert Systems (Buchanan and Shortliffe, 1984) provides a complete
overview of MYCIN and its descendants (see also Stefik, 1995). David Heckerman (1986)
showed that a slightly modified version of certainty factor calculations gives correct proba-
bilistic results in some cases, but results in serious overcounting of evidence in other cases.

Fuzzysetsweredevelopedby Lotfi Zadeh(1965)inresponsetotheperceiveddifficulty
of providing exact inputs to intelligent systems. The text by Zimmermann (2001) provides
a thorough introduction to fuzzy set theory; papers on fuzzy applications are collected in
Zimmermann (1999). As we mentioned in the text, fuzzy logic has often been perceived

connections betweenpossibility theoryandprobability theory.
The resurgence of probability depended mainly on Pearl s development of Bayesian
