7.7.3 Logicalstateestimation
The agent program in Figure 7.20 works quite well, but it has one major weakness: as time
goesby,thecomputationalexpenseinvolvedinthecallsto AS Kgoesupandup. Thishappens
mainlybecausetherequiredinferenceshavetogobackfurtherandfurtherintimeandinvolve
more and more proposition symbols. Obviously, this is unsustainable we cannot have an
agent whose timetoprocess each percept grows inproportion to the length ofits life! What

As we saw in Section 4.4, the past history of percepts and all their ramifications can
bereplaced bythe beliefstate that is,somerepresentation ofthesetofallpossible current

state estimation. Whereas in Section 4.4 the belief state was an explicit list of states, here
we can use a logical sentence involving the proposition symbols associated with the current
timestep,aswellastheatemporal symbols. Forexample,the logicalsentence
Wumpus Alive1 L1 B (P P ) (7.4)
2,1 2,1 3,1 2,2
represents the set of all states at time 1 in which the wumpus is alive, the agent is at 2,1 ,
