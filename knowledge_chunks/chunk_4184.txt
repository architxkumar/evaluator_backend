Planning 261 The sequence of operators applied so far is UNSTACK(CA) PUTDOWN(C) PICKUP(A) STACK(A, B) Ben NS Now we can begin to work on satisfying ON(B, C). Without going through all the detail, we can see that our algorithm will attempt to achieve this goal by stacking B on C. But to do that, it has to unstack A from B. By the time we have achieved the goal ON(B, C) and popped it off the stack, we will have executed the following additional sequence of operators: UNSTACK(A, B) PUTDOWN(A) PICKUP(B) STACK(B, C) PAI DNA The problem state will be ON@, C) A ONTABLE(A) A B ONTABLE(C) A c|[A ARMEMPTY But now when we check the remaining goal on the stack, ON(A, B) A ON(B, C) we discover that it is not satisfied. We have undone ON(A, B) in the process of achieving ON(B, C). The difference between the goal and the current state is ON(A, B), which is now added to the stack so that it can be achieved again. This time, the sequence of operators 9. PICKUP(A) 10. STACK(A, B) is found. Now the combined goal is again checked, and this time it is satisfied. The complete plan that has been discovered is UNSTACK(C.A) PUTDOWN(C) PICKUP(A) STACK(A.B) UNSTACK(A, B) i VRYN SO SO Wr ND PUTDOWN(A) PICKUP(B) STACK(B, C) PICKUP(A) STACK(A, B) Although this plan will achieve the desired goal, it does not do so very efficiently. A similar situation would have occurred if we had examined the two major subgoals in the opposite order. The method we are using is not capable of finding an efficient way of solving this problem. 262 Artificial Intelligence ial There are two approaches we can take to the question of how a good plan can be found. One is to look at ways to repair the plan we already have to make it more efficient. In this case, that is fairly easy to do. We can look for places in the plan where we perform an operation and then
