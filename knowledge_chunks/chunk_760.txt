 agent ever be sure that it has updated its beliefs to reflect all the changes that are a consequence of its actions? Drew McDermott s response to this is that even humans are unable to guarantee this and can make mistakes (McDermott, 1987). We have to assume that everything that matters has been stated explicitly. Given such an assumption and given the facts, the conclusion arrived at by the derivation is then indeed entailed by what is stated (including the assumption). Thus under such an assumption both PersistsBetween(t,, inflated(bicycle39), t3) and 7Clipped(t, inflated(bicycle39), t2) will hold, and we will be able to conclude that bike is inflated at time fg at line 15. For the conclusion to be an entailment it means that it must be true in all models of the set of EC formulas describing the domain, the EC axioms, and situation and the events. A model is a combination of a domain and mapping of EC statements and terms to relations and elements in the domain. The following additkaratlagseptions need to be made. Unique Name Axioms The first thing that one must assert is that terms or fluents that are named differently actually map to different elements in the domain. For example the fact that fillAir and eat refer to distinct events. Such assertions are typically made as unique name axioms (UNA). Thus we should say that, UNA(loc, inflated, worksPlanRide, worksPlanEat) UNA(fillAir, planToRide, planToEat, ride, eat) UNA(nikhil53, home86, bicycle39, restaurant66, cricketPractice11) The meaning of a UNA statement is that all its arguments are distinct. Predicate Completion The next fact we must assert is that the events have no unstated effects, and that no unstated events have actually happened. Completion of the nitiates predicate is done by listing all known events that initiate fluents and the corresponding fluents. Thus if nitiates(e, f t) is true then e and f can only take one of the following pairs of values. Observe that the e, f and t are universally quant
