15.3.2 Hidden Markov model example: Localization
Onpage145,weintroducedasimpleformofthelocalizationproblemforthevacuumworld.
In that version, the robot had a single nondeterministic Move action and its sensors reported
perfectly whether or not obstacles lay immediately to the north, south, east, and west; the
robot sbeliefstatewasthesetofpossiblelocations itcouldbein.
Here we make the problem slightly more realistic by including a simple probability
model forthe robot s motion andby allowing fornoise inthesensors. Thestate variable X
t
represents the location of the robot on the discrete grid; the domain of this variable is the
set of empty squares s
