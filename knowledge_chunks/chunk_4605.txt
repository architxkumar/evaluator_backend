A Three-Agent Scenario Let s now look into a scenario where three agents communicate. Table 25.5 provides the PROLOG source code for each of these. Ensure that you change the i P addresses to those of the machines where the agents are to run. Naturally the three agents viz. antonym, synonym and sentence are to be loaded and compiled on three separate instantiations of WIN-PROLOG. For brevity these have been christened as ant, syn and sen respectively in our discussions. The ant provides the antonym of a given word and also passes this information to the agent syn that provides for its synonym. The latter also proactively contacts sen and requests it to provide an example sentence for the input word. Together the three agents provide the user with antonyms, synonyms and an example sentence that uses the input word. The prime objective of discussing this i
