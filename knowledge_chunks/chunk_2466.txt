Wecan answerthisquestion byusing astatistical significance test. Suchatest begins

byassumingthatthereisnounderlying pattern (theso-called nullhypothesis). Thentheac-

tualdataareanalyzed tocalculate theextenttowhichtheydeviate fromaperfect absence of
pattern. Ifthe degree ofdeviation isstatistically unlikely (usually taken to meana5 prob-
ability or less), then that is considered to be good evidence for the presence of a significant
patterninthedata. Theprobabilities arecalculatedfromstandarddistributions oftheamount
ofdeviation onewouldexpecttoseeinrandomsampling.
In this case, the null hypothesis is that the attribute is irrelevant and, hence, that the
information gain for an infinitely large sample would be zero. We need to calculate the
probability that, under the null hypothesis, a sample of size v n p would exhibit the
observeddeviationfromtheexpecteddistribution ofpositiveandnegativeexamples. Wecan
