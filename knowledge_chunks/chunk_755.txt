Happens(planToEat(nikhil53, restaurant66), ts) Happens(planToRide(nikhil53, bicycle39, restaurant66, cricketPractice11), ty) The sequence of predicates could (logically) be stated in any order, and we also assert the following relations between the time points, 6. ty to 7. toxts 8. t3 ty 9. ty ts 10. t5 t 11. te tz 12. t7 ts 13. ts tg We would like to be able to deduce that at time fo t7 Nikhil is at cricket practice, represented by HoldsAt loc(cricketPractice11, nikhil53), tg). To be able to do this we will need to add knowledge in the form of rules relating the events to the states. Such knowledge is called a set of domain axioms. For the above problem we need the following axioms. All variables are implicitly universally quantified. Axiom A; states that event fil Air(P, B) initiates the fluent inflated(B) at some time T. That is, fluent inflated(B) becomes true after time T as a consequence of action fillAir(P B) which happens at time T. OARWN A: Initiates(fillAir(P, B), inflated(B), 7) Axiom Ap states that if the preconditions of riding a bike, being at the source and the bike (tyres) being inflated, are true then the intention of riding the bike will 20 suceRedirti ut.com Ap: ((HoldsAt(inflated(B), T) HoldsAt(loc(P, S), 7))) Initiates(planToRide(P, B, S, D), worksPlanRide(P, B, Heeingu som Axiom A3 is known as a trigger axiom. A trigger axiom describes a set of fluents, in this example only one, that are triggers for events. When the trigger fluents become true the events are triggered automatically. Axiom Ag states that if the fluent worksPlanRide holds then the ride event happens. A3: HoldsAt(worksPlanRide(P, B, S, D), T) D Happens(ride(P, B, S, D), i) The reason we have set up these elaborate inferences is because in our story, we have only said that Nikhil has an intention or plan to ride the bicycle to the r
