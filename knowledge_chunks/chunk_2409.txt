Now let s look at a game that has no dominant strategy. Acme, a video game console
manufacturer, has todecide whether itsnext gamemachine willuse Blu-ray discs or DV Ds.
Meanwhile, the video game software producer Best needs to decide whether to produce its

There is no dominant strategy equilibrium for this game, but there are two Nash equilibria:
(bluray, bluray) and (dvd, dvd). We know these are Nash equilibria because if either player
unilaterally movestoadifferent strategy, thatplayer willbeworse off. Nowtheagents have
a problem: there are multiple acceptable solutions, but if each agent aims for a different
solution, then both agents will suffer. How can they agree on a solution? One answer is
that both should choose the Pareto-optimal solution (bluray, bluray); that is, we can restrict
thedefinition of solution totheunique Pareto-optimal Nashequilibrium provided that one
exists. Every game has at least one Pareto-optimal solution, but a game might have several,
or they might not be equilibrium points. For example, if (bluray, bluray) had payoff (5,
5), then there would be two equal Pareto-optimal equilibrium points. To choose between

them the agents can either guess or communicate, which can be done either by establishing
a convention that orders the solutions before the game begins or by negotiating to reach a
mutually beneficial solution during the game (which would mean including co
