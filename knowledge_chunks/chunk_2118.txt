To answer the questions below, your knowledge base must include background knowledge.
You ll have to deal with what kind of things are at a supermarket, what is involved with
purchasingthethingsoneselects,whatthepurchaseswillbeusedfor,andsoon. Trytomake
your representation as general as possible. Togive a trivial example: don t say People buy
foodfrom Safeway, becausethatwon thelpyouwiththosewhoshopatanothersupermarket.
Also,don tturnthequestionsintoanswers;forexample,question(c)asks Did Johnbuyany
meat? not Did Johnbuyapoundofgroundbeef? Sketch the chains of reasoning that would answer the questions. If possible, use a
logicalreasoningsystemtodemonstratethesufficiencyofyourknowledgebase. Manyofthe
things you write might be only approximately correct in reality, but don t worry too much;
the idea is to extract the common sense that lets you answer these questions at all. A truly
