How could they be purely syntactic machines with about when we are so situated in our real world? Or are our real worlds a creation of our mind s believe? However we do (seem to) have our physical selves and we do live in our physical env about it and acting on it. Perhaps it is the marvel of evolution that our perceptive system has evolv rocessing mind (Dawkins, 1996). FOLRules ositional logic rules we saw earlier are valid in FOL as well. In addition we need new rules t 1 statements. The two commonly used rules of inference are, Vx P(x) P(a) P dx P(x) slowing rules of substitution are also useful, wWWxa dena De Morgan s law dx ao Vxa De Morgan s law Vx Vy a Vy Vx a Ixdya Aoika : following rules the notation A x stands for the fact that A is a formula containing x, while A sta that does not contain x (as in (Manna, 1974).

Many of the seemingly strange sw s around the operator can be explained by the fact that (a D B) has a hidden negation sign inside the equivalent form ( aV 8). When the negation moves across a quantifier it transforms the existe a
