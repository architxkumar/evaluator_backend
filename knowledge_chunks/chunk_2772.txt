way that seems a little complicated, but is designed to have a simple probability dis-

Figure 23.13 shows an example of the process. At the top, the sentence There is a smelly

into a corresponding phrase f , and then these are permuted into the order f ,f ,f ,f ,f .

Now that we have defined the distortion, d , we can define the probability distribution
