(Rossum s Universal Robots). The robots, which were grown chemically rather than con-
structed mechanically, end up resenting their masters and decide to take over. It appears
(Glanc, 1978) it was Capek s brother, Josef, who first combined the Czech words robota (obligatory work)and robotnik (serf)toyield robot in his1917shortstory Opilec.
Theterm robotics was firstused by Asimov(1950). Robotics (under other names) has

was supposedly designed and built by Hephaistos, the Greek god of metallurgy. Wonderful
automata were built in the 18th century Jacques Vaucanson s mechanical duck from 1738
