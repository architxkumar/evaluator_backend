Hence,weseethatthecalculation ofb isalmostidentical totheobservable case, whichwas
specifiedby Equation(10.1)onpage368:
b (cid:2) RESULT(b,a) (b DEL(a)) ADD(a).

We cannot quite use the set semantics because (1) we must make sure that b does not con-
tain both (cid:3) and (cid:3), and (2) atoms may contain unbound variables. But it is still the case
that RESULT(b,a) is computed by starting with b, setting any atom that appears in DEL(a)
to false, and setting any atom that appears in ADD(a) to true. For example, if we apply

The preceding analysis of the update rule has shown a very important fact: the family
of belief states defined as conjunctions of literals is closed under updates defined by PDDL
actionschemas. Thatis,ifthebelief statestartsasaconjunction ofliterals, thenanyupdate
will yield a conjunction of literals. That means that in a world with n fluents, any belief
state can be represented by a conjunction of size O(n). This is a very comforting result,
considering that there are 2n states in the world. It says we can compactly represent all the
subsetsofthose2n s
