on Logical consequences. A sentence is a logical consequence of another if it is satisfied by all interpretations which satisfy the first. More generally, it is a logical consequence of other Statements if and only if for any interpretation in which the statements are true, the resulting statement is also true. A valid statement is stisable, and a contradictory statement is invalid, but the converse is not necessarily true. As examples of the above definition-, consider the following statements. P is satisfiable but not valid since an interpretation that assigns false to P assigns false to the sentence P. P V P is valid since every interpretation results in a value of true for (P V P). P & P is a contradiction since every interpretation results in a value of false for (P & P). P and TP) are equivalent since each has the same truth values under every interpretation. P is a logical consequence of (P & Q) since any interpretation for which (P & Q) is true. P is also true. The notion of logical consequence provides us with a means to perform valid inferencing in PL. The following are two important theorems which give criteria for a statement to be a logical consequence of a set of statements. Theorem 4.1. The sentence a is a logical consequence of .c ,...,s it &. and only ifs1 &s2 . . &s,,-.sisvalid. Theorem 4.2. The sentence a is a logical consequence of s1 ....,s,, if and only iffs1 & s, & . . . & a,, & s is inconsistent. The proof of theorem 4.1 can be seen by first noting that if s is a logical consequence of s1 ......,,. then for any interpretation I in which S 1 & a. &, & a,, is true, s is also true by definition. Hence s & a, & ... & s -p a is true. On the other hand, if a1 & a2 & . . . & a,, - .c is valid, then for any interpretation I if a1 & a2 & . . . & a,, is true, a is true also. The proof of theorem 4.2 follows directly from theorem 41 since a is a Sec. 4.2 Syntax and Semantics for Propositional Logic 53 TABLE 4.2 SOME EQUIVALENCE LAWS Idempotency pv P P P
