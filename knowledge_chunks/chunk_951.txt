ntion. All attributes should match well with this aggregation function. Analogous to the Max-k aggregation, we can also define Min-k aggregation functions that are progressively less strict. The formal definition is left as an exercise for the reader. The global similarity depends upon the local similarities of the attributes and also the weights assigned to the attributes. Let us consider a small fictitious case base of employees in a fictitious company called Anokhi Research . The case base is given in Table 15.2 below. Let us assume the task is to predict the salary of a new (query) candidate, based on the salaries of the most similar candidates. The case schema contains the following attributes, Name: Employee name. Not used in the similarity function. Weight 0 Gender: M or F . Uses equality as similarity. Weight 10 Age: Numeric. Uses a linear similarity function with range 50. Weight 10 Experience: Numeric. Linear function with range 50. Weight 10 . Education: Unordered symbol. Similarity table. Weight 20 . HandOn?: Boolean. Uses equality as similarity. Weight 10 Salary: Solution attribute. Numeric. The attribute Education takes three values: Bachelors , Masters and PhD . One could have defined this as an ordered symbol type. Choosing a user defined table however, allows us to define the local similarities explicitly. We define the following similarity table for the attribute Education.
