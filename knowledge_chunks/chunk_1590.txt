To illustrate hill climbing, we will use the 8-queens problem introduced on page 71.
Local search algorithms typically use a complete-state formulation, where each state has
8 queens on the board, one per column. The successors of a state are all possible states
generated bymoving asingle queen toanothersquare inthesamecolumn (soeachstate has
8 7 56 successors). The heuristic cost function h is the number of pairs of queens that
are attacking each other, either directly or indirectly. The global minimum of this function
iszero, whichoccurs only atperfect solutions. Figure 4.3(a) showsastate withh 17. The
figure also shows the values of all its successors, with the best successors having h 12.

state. For example, from the state in Figure 4.3(a), it takes just five steps to reach the state
in Figure 4.3(b), which has h 1 and is very nearly a solution. Unfortunately, hill climbing

states but lower than the global maximum. Hill-climbing algorithms that reach the
vicinity of a local maximum will be drawn upward toward the peak but will then be
stuck with nowhere else to go. Figure 4.1 illustrates the problem schematically. More
