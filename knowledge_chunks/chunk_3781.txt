his rule could, however, have been written as, Fill the 4-gallon jug, since it is physically possible to fill the jug even if it is already full. It is stupid to do so since no change in the problem state results, but it is possible. By encoding in the left sides of the rules constraints that are not strictly necessary but that restrict the application of the rules to states in which the rules are most likely to lead to a solution, we can generally increase the efficiency of the problem-solving program that uses the rules. 2? The word operator refers to some representation of an action. An operator usually includes information about what must be true in the world before the action can take place, and how the world is changed by the action. ee 28 Artificial Intelligence I @y ~ 4y) Fill the 4-gallon jug ifx<4 2 (x, y) 23> 3) Fill the 3-gallon jug ify<3 3 wy) > @-dy) Pour some water out of ifx>0 the 4-galion jug 4 (, y) ~ @wy-d) Pour some water out of ify>0O the 3-gallon jug 5 (x, y} ~ Oy Empty the 4-gallon jug ifx>0O on the ground 6 @y) => 0) Empty the 3-gailon jug ify>0 on the ground 7 (wy) > A y-(4-x)) Pour water from the ifx+y24andy>0 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug until the 4-gallon jug is full 8 Gy, y ) ~~ (-(-Yy), 3) Pour water from the ifx+y23andx>0 4-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug until the 3-galion jug is full 9 y) > (xt+y,0) Pour all the water ifx+ys4andy>0 from the 3-gatlon jug into the 4-galion jug 10 @, y) > (O,x+y) Pour all the water ifx+y<3andx>0 from the 4-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug 11 (0, 2) > (2,0) Pour the 2 gallons from the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug 12 (2, ) + Oy) Empty the 2 gallons in ! the 4-gallon jug on the ground Fig. 2.3.
