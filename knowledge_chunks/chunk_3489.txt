ul system SHROLU developed by Terry Winograd (1972). This syst& ri is described later in the chapter. Semantic Gran imars Semantic gram mars encode semantic information into a syntactic grammar. They use context-fre e rewrite rules with nonterminal semantic constituents. The constituents are categories, or metasymbols such as attribute, object, present (as in display), and ship, ratl ter than NP, VP. N. V. and so on. This approach greatly restricts the range of sen tences which can be generated and requires a large number of rewrite rules. Sema tic grammars have proven to be successful in limited applications including LIFER., a data base query system distributed by the Navy which is accessible lough A RPANET (Hendrix et al.. 1978), and a tutorial system named SOPHIE which is 1 .jsed to teach the debugging of circuit faults. Rewrite rules in these systems cssentialy take the forms S What is <OUTPUT-PROPERTY> of <CIRCUIT-PART>' OUTPUT-PROPERTY -p the <OUTPUT-PROP> OUTPUT-PROPERTY - < OUTPUT-PROP> CIRCUIT-PART . C23 CIRCUIT-PART . D12 OUTPUT-PROP . voltage OUTPUT-PROP . current In the LIFER system, there are rules to handle numerous forms of wh-queries such as What is the name and location of the carrier nearest to New York Who commands the Kennedy 240 Natural Language Processing Chap. 12 Which convoy escorts have inoperative radar units When will they be repaired What Soviet ship has hull number 820 These sentences are analyzed and words matched to metasymbols contained in lexicon entries. Forexample, the input statement "Print the length of the Enterprise" would lit with the LIFER top grammar rule (L.T.G.) of the form -PRESENT the A1TR IOU TE ' of -SHIP, where print matches <PRESENT>, length matches <AT1'RIBUTE>, and the Enterprise matches <SHIP>. Other typical lexicon entries that can match <ATTRIBUTE> include CLASS, COMMANDER. FUEL. TYPE. BEAM. LENGTH, and so on. LIFER can also accommodate elliptical (incomplete) inputs. Given the query is the length of the Kenned
