9.3 FORWARD CHAINING
A forward-chaining algorithm for propositional definite clauses was given in Section 7.5.
The idea is simple: start with the atomic sentences in the knowledge base and apply Modus
Ponens in the forward direction, adding new atomic sentences, until no further inferences
can be made. Here, we explain how the algorithm is applied to first-order definite clauses.

9.3.1 First-order definite clauses
First-order definite clauses closely resemble propositional definite clauses (page 256): they
aredisjunctions ofliterals ofwhich exactly oneispositive. Adefiniteclause eitherisatomic
or is an implication whose antecedent is a conjunction of positive literals and whose conse-
quentisasinglepositiveliteral. Thefollowingarefirst-orderdefiniteclauses:
King(x) Greedy(x) Evil(x).
King(John).
Greedy(y).
Unlike propositional literals, first-order literals can include variables, in which case those
variables are assumed to be universally quantified. (Typically, we omit universal quantifiers
when writing definite clauses.) Not every knowledge base can be converted into a set of
definite clauses because of the single-positive-literal restriction, but many can. Consider the
followingproblem:
