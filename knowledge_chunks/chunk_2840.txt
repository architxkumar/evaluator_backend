24.5.2 Coherent appearance: Tracking people invideo
Tracking people in video is an important practical problem. If we could reliably report the
location of arms, legs, torso, and head in video sequences, we could build much improved
game interfaces and surveillance systems. Filtering methods have not had much success
withthisproblem, because people canproduce large accelerations andmovequite fast. This
means that for 30 Hz video, the configuration of the body in frame i doesn t constrain the
configurationofthebodyinframei 1allthatstrongly. Currently,themosteffectivemethods
exploit thefactthatappearance changes veryslowlyfromframetoframe. Ifwecaninferan
appearance model of an individual from the video, then we can use this information in a
pictorial structure model to detect that person in each frame of the video. We can then link
theselocations acrosstimetomakeatrack.

There are several ways to infer a good appearance model. We regard the video as a
large stack of pictures of the person we wish to track. We can
