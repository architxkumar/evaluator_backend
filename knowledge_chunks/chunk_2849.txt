image-processing algorithms extract primitive features from the image, such as edges
andregions. There are various cues in the image that enable one to obtain three-dimensional in-
formation about the scene: motion, stereopsis, texture, shading, and contour analysis.
Eachof these cues relies on background assumptions about physical scenes to provide
nearlyunambiguous interpretations. Objectrecognitioninitsfullgeneralityisaveryhardproblem. Wediscussedbrightness-

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES
Theeye developed in the Cambrian explosion (530 million years ago), apparently in acom-
mon ancestor. Since then, endless variations have developed in different creatures, but the
same gene, Pax-6, regulates the development of the eye in animals as diverse as humans,
mice,and Drosophila.
Systematic attempts to understand human vision can be traced back to ancient times.
