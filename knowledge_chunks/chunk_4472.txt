2.0] This will aid in determining the category of ORGANISM-1. It has already been established that [2.1] the gram stain of ORGANISM-1 is gramneg, and {2.2] the morphology of ORGANISM-~1 is rod, and [2.3] the aerobicity of ORGANISM-1 is facultative Therefore, if [2.4] the infection with ORGANISM-1 was not acquired while the patient was hospitalized, then there is strongly suggestive evidence (.8) that the category of ORGANISM-1 is enterobacteriaceae {ALSO: there is weakly suggestive evidence (.1) that the identity of ORGANISM-1 is pseudomonas-aeruginosa] {RULE037] ** HOW [2.3] [ie., HOW was it established that the aerobicity of ORGANISN-1 is facultative?] The following were used: [3.1] RULE027 indicated there is strongly suggestive evidence (.8) that the aerobicity of ORGANISM-1 is facultative. [3.2] RULE033 indicated there is weakly suggestive evidence (.2) that the aerobicity of ORGANISM-t is not facultative. Since this gave a cumulative CF of (.6) for facultative, the evidence indicates that the aerobicity of ORGANISM-1 is facultative. Fig. 20.1 A Portion of a Dialogue with TEIRESIAS When TEIRESIAS provides the answer to the first of these questions, the user may be satisfied or may want to follow the reasoning process back even further. The user can do that by asking additional WHY questions. When TEIRESIAS provides the answer to the second of these questions and tells the user what it already believes, the user may want to know the basis for those beliefs. The user can ask this with a HOW question, which TEIRESIAS will interpret as How did you know that? This question also can be answered by looking at the goal tree and chaining backward from the stated fact to the evidence that allowed a rule that determined the fact to fire. Thus we see that by reasoning backward from its top-level goal and by keeping track of the entire tree that it traverses in the process, TEIRESIASMYCIN can do a fairly good job of justifying its reasoning to a human user.
