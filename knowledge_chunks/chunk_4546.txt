ominant and thus we may use inequalities while expressing probabilities. If the length of the solution strings is high and the population contains diverse solutions it tends to reduce the effect of the mate. Thus the probability of the above schema S, dying out is given by Pq = (Number of Crossing sites within the defining length)/ (Total Number of Crossing sites) = &S\V(L 1) = 4/6 +(23,4) where L is the length of the solution. Since crossover itself takes place with a probability p, it can be inferred that Pa Sp. HSE - 1) (23.5) The inequality takes into consideration the effect of mates that can prevent such destruction. The probability that the schema S will survive p,, would be (1 p,). If we assume that reproduction and crossover are independent of each other, the probability that the schema will survive both the operations will be given by the product of their respective probabilities. 476 Artificial Intelligence Habeas UA NEI e NO ENCE m(S, t+ 1) 2 m(S,0SME np} Ps (23.6) 23.7.6 Effect of Changes on Schemata Due to Mutation We assume that p,, is the mutation probability of a bit in a solution string. If a solution string 1010111 of length 7 belonging to the schemata S, = 1*****1 mutates at one bit position to become 1010110 then S; is lost. Thus p,, is actually the probability of a bit being destroyed. The survival probability of an individual bit would be (1 p,,). In a schema we need to take into consideration only the changes in the constant bit positions defined by the order of the schemata o(S). Since there are o(S) number of such bit positions, each having a survival probability of (1~ p,,), the overall probability of survivability of the schema due to mutation would be (1 p,,) . Since p,, is generally chosen to be a small value, this probability may be approximated to 1~p,,- o(S). Taking this effect too into account we modify the equation for m(S, t+ 1) as m S, t+ 1) 2 m(S, 1) - (FSVfoy) Ps {1 - Pm OCS) m S, 1). + FSMfayd Ope ASML Y} {1 = py 0(S)} Neglect
