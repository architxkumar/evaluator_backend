s that it holds when the distances are unbounded. If the distance were to be normalized to the range 0,1 to define do 4)(X, Y), this relationship breaks down. For example, if the distance dio 1;(Q,7) were to be 0.9, and ajo 1,(7, C) were 0.5, then the upper bound distance djg,4(Q, C) cannot be greater than 1. This observation is also relevant if we were to apply the equivalent triangle inequality for similarity values. Assuming that, sim(X, Y) 1 dfo,4(X, Y) we can combine the above three equations to give us the bounds on similarity values as, sim(Q, C) s sim(Q, T) - sim(T, C) 1 (upper bound) sim(Q, C) 2 sim(Q, T) sim(T, C) - 1 (lower bound) This is consistent with the definition of triangle inequality for similarity (Burkhard and Richter, 2000). A similarity measure fulfils the triangle inequality if sim(x, y) sim(y, Z) 1 sim(x, z) holds for all x, y, z. However, note that if sim(Q, T) 0.9 and sim(T, C) 0.1 then the upper bound on sim(Q, C) becomes 1.8. Observe that this says that Q is quite similar to T, and T is not similar to C. Therefore, one would expect that C will not be very similar to Q. The upper bound then is only notional. Likewise, if the sim(Q, T) 0.1 and sim(T, C) 0.1, then the lower bound on sim(Q, C) becomes 0.8. This suggests that the bounds be confined to the range 0,1 "". sim(Q, C) s min(1, sim(Q, T) sim(T, C) 1) (upper bound) sim(Q, C) max(0, sim(Q, T) sim(T, C) 1) (lower bound) We illustrate the behaviour of Fish and Shrink algorithm with a hypothetical example. In Figure 15.26 below, we plot the bounds on the similarity values of each case with the query. When a query Q arrives, the Fish and Shrink algorithm begins by initializing the lower bound on similarity of all cases to 0, and the upper bounds to 1. The possible range of similarity values is depicted by shaded vertical bands for each case. FIGURE 15.26 The Fish and Shrink algorithm begins by keeping the widest bounds on the similarity values of all N cases. The feasible values are shown
