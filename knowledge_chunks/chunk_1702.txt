5.10 Considerthefamilyofgeneralized tic-tac-toe games,definedasfollows. Eachpartic-
ular game is specified by a set S of squares and a collection W of winning positions. Each
winningpositionisasubsetof S. Forexample,instandardtic-tac-toe, S isasetof9squares
and W isacollectionof8subsetsof W: thethreerows,thethreecolumns,andthetwodiag-
onals. Inotherrespects, thegameisidentical tostandard tic-tac-toe. Startingfromanempty
board, players alternate placing their marks on an empty square. A player who marks every
square in a winning position wins the game. It is a tie if all squares are marked and neither
playerhaswon.
a. Let N S , the number of squares. Give an upper bound on the number of nodes in
thecompletegametreeforgeneralized tic-tac-toe asafunction of N.
b. Givealowerboundonthesizeofthegametreefortheworstcase,where W .
c. Proposeaplausibleevaluationfunctionthatcanbeusedforanyinstanceofgeneralized

d. Assume that it is possible to generate a new board and check whether it is a winning
position in 100N machine instructions and assume a 2 gigahertz processor. Ignore
memory limitations. Using your estimate in (a), roughly how large agame tree can be
