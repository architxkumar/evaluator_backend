is dealt to each player. The first player then has the option
to raise the stakes of the game from 1 point to 2, or to check. If player 1 checks, the game
is over. If he raises, then player 2 has the option to call, accepting that the game is worth 2
points, or fold, conceding the 1 point. If the game does not end with a fold, then the payoff
depends on the cards: it is zero for both players if they have the same card; otherwise the
