CONDITIONING
forallkindsofderivations involving probability expressions.
In most cases, we are interested in computing conditional probabilities of some vari-
ables, given evidence about others. Conditional probabilities can be found by first using

The two values sum to 1.0, as they should. Notice that in these two calculations t
