As the saying goes, algorithms that forget their history are doomed to repeat it. The
way to avoid exploring redundant paths is to remember where one has been. To do this, we

augment the TREE-SEARCH algorithm with a data structure called the explored set (also
known as the closed list), which remembers every expanded node. Newly generated nodes
