 on GPS is the recursive approach to problem solving. The key to performance in GPS is an ordering of the differences to be addressed, and the availability of operators to reduce the differences. One desirable property of the operators is that applying an operator to reduce a difference should not undo the work of a previous operator. We have seen that such a problem can occur even in the blocks world with the example on Sussman s anomaly. While it may not be possible to find primitive operators that satisfy this property, Korf has shown that one could construct operator difference tables in which the operators are not primitive operators, but chunked together into macros. In other words, one can even tackle nonserializable subgoals by devising macro moves that can be applied in a serial order (see also the section on Peak-to-Peak Heuristics in Chapter 3). Table 7.2 below shows the macro table for the Eight-puzzle (taken from (Korf, 85)) for the goal state shown in Figure 7.24.
