secutive sideways moves allowed. Forexample, we could allow up to, say, 100 consecutive
sideways moves in the 8-queens problem. This raises the percentage of problem instances
solved by hill climbing from 14 to 94 . Success comes at a cost: the algorithm averages
roughly 21stepsforeachsuccessful instance and64foreach failure.

HILLCLIMBING

is found. It is trivially complete with probability approaching 1, because it will eventually
generate a goal state as the initial state. If each hill-climbing search has a probability p of
success, then the expected number of restarts required is 1 p. For 8-queens instances with
