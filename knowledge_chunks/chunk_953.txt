The weights are the similarity values. Based on this, the expected salary of Ayesha is, Salaryexpected (6200 x 0.99 6650 x 0.99 13300 x 0.93) (0.99 0.99 0.93) 8622 The reader would have observed that the retrieved cases match exactly on Gender, Education and HandsOn? attributes, and for those attributes the local similarity is 1. Let us try a new weight schema which gives less weight to Gender and more to Age, as shown below. weight 1 10 20 10 The new retrieval set is, with simil 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 0 1 0.94 0.98 1 1 3 i) 0 098 0.96 1 1 Observe, that while Anuragini and Aryenish still occupy the first two positions, Anzhela has been replaced by Abdul. Also note that the predicted salaries are more similar in the three retrieved cases, yielding, SAlarYeypecred (6200 x 0.99 6650 x 0.97 6500 x 0.97)0.99 0.97 0.97) 6449 What has happened in the second set is that because we have reduced the weight of Gender, and increased the weight of Age, a different set of cases has a higher similarity value. The three cases are similar in all other respects and also predict a similar salary. This suggests that in our (fictitious) case base, gender does not matter. This fact will be borne out when we construct a decision tree for the given case base in a later chapter. Let us try another query.
