Utilities: What if wedon t know ouropponent s utilities? Again, that can be modeled
with a chance node, such that the other agent knows its own utilities in each branch, but we
don t. But what if we don t know our own utilities? For example, how do I know if it is

In the previous section, we asked, Given a game, what is a rational strategy? In this sec-
