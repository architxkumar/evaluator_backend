8.14 Write axioms describing the predicates Grandchild, Greatgrandparent, Ancestor,
Brother, Sister, Daughter, Son, First Cousin, Brother In Law, Sister In Law, Aunt, and
Uncle. Find out the proper definition of mth cousin n times removed, and write the def-
inition in first-order logic. Now write down the basic facts depicted in the family tree in
Figure 8.7. Using a suitable logical reasoning system, TELL it all the sentences you have
writtendown,and ASK itwhoare Elizabeth s grandchildren, Diana sbrothers-in-law, Zara s
great-grandparents, and Eugenie sancestors.
