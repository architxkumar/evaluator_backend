The CYK algorithm uses space of O(n2m) for the P table, where n is the number of
wordsinthesentence,andmisthenumberofnonterminalsymbolsinthegrammar,andtakes
time O(n3m). (Sincemisconstant foraparticular grammar, this iscommonly described as
O(n3).) No algorithm can do better for general context-free grammars, although there are

It is ambiguous because each word (except and ) can be either a noun ora verb, and fall and spring can be adjectives as well. (For example, one meaning of Fall leaves fall is
