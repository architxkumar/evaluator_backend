 CURRENT, should be MINIMAX-A-B(CURRENT, 0, PLAYER-ONE, maximum value STATIC can compute, minimum value STATIC can compute) These initial values for Use-Thresh and Pass-Thresh represent the worst values that each side could achieve. Algorithm: MINIM AX-A-B( Position, Depth, Player, Use-Thresh, Pass-Thresh) 1. If DEEP-ENOUGH(Position, Depth), then return the structure VALUE = STATIC(Position, Player); PATH = nil 2. Otherwise, generate one more ply of the tree by calling the function MOVEGEN(Position, Player) and setting SUCCESSORS to the list it returns. 3. If SUCCESSORS is empty, there are no moves to be made; return the same structure that would have been retumed if DEEP-ENOUGH had returned TRUE. 4. If SUCCESSORS is not empty, then go through it, examining each element and keeping track of the best one. This is done as follows. For each element SUCC of SUCCESSORS: (a) Set RESULT-SUCC to MINIMAX-A-B(SUCC, Depth + 1, OPPOSITE(Player), Pass-Thresh, Use-Thresh). (b) Set NEW-VALUE to -VALUE(RESULT-SUCC). (c) If NEW-VALUE > Pass-Thresh, then we have found a successor that is better than any that have been examined so far. Record this by doing the following. (i) Set Pass-Thresh to NEW-VALUE. (ii) The best known path is now from CURRENT to SUCC and then on to the appropriate path from SUCC as determined by the recursive call to MINIMAX-A-B. So set BEST-PATH to the result of attaching SUCC to the front of PATH(RESULT-SUCC). 240 Artificial Intelligence AAR RR RN IEE AIEEE (d) Wf Pass-Thresh (reflecting the current best value) is not better than Use-Thresh, then we should stop examining this branch. But both thresholds and values have been inverted. So if Pass-Thresh >= Use-Thresh, then return immediately with the value VALUE = Pass-Thresh PATH = BEST-PATH 5. Return the structure VALUE = Pass-Thresh PATH = BEST-PATH The effectiveness of the alpha-beta procedure depends greatly on the order in which paths are examined. If the worst paths are A] @=3) examined first, then no cut
