Combining all the techniques described here results in a program that can play cred-

amillionnodespersecondonthelatest PC,allowingustosearchroughly 200millionnodes
per move under standard time controls (three minutes per move). The branching factor for
chess is about 35, on average, and 355 is about 50 million, so if we used minimax search,
we could look ahead only about fiveplies. Though not incompetent, such a program can be

play. Section5.8describes additional pruningtechniques thatcanextendtheeffectivesearch
depth to roughly 14 plies. To reach grandmaster status we would need an extensively tuned
