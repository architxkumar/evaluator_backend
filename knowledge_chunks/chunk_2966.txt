Chinese Room has been debated endlessly (Searle, 1980, 1990; Preston and Bishop, 2002).
We ll just mention here a related work: Terry Bisson s (1990) science fiction story They re
Made out of Meat, in which alien robotic explorers who visit earth are incredulous to find
thinking humanbeings whosemindsaremadeofmeat. Presumably, therobotic alien equiv-

Ethical issues in AI predate the existence of the field itself. I. J. Good s (1965) ul-
traintelligent machine idea was foreseen a hundred years earlier by Samuel Butler (1863).
Written four years after the publication of Darwin s On the Origins of Species and at a time

Thephilosophical literature onminds,brains, andrelated topicsislargeanddifficultto
read without training in the terminology and methods of argument employed. The Encyclo-
pedia of Philosophy (Edwards, 1967) is an impressively authoritative and very useful aid in
this process. The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (Audi, 1999) is a shorter and more
accessible work, and the online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy offers many excellent
articles and up-to-date references. The MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science (Wilson and
Keil, 1999) covers the philosophy of mind as well as the biology and psychology of mind.
There are several general introductions to the philosophical AI question (Boden, 1990;
Haugeland, 1985; Copeland, 1993; Mc Corduck, 2004; Minsky, 2007). The Behavioral and
Brain Sciences, abbreviated BBS, is a major journal devoted to philosophical and scientific
debates about AI and neuroscienc
