Simulated annealing was first described by Kirkpatrick et al. (1983), who borrowed
directly from the Metropolis algorithm (which is used to simulate complex systems in
physics(Metropolisetal.,1953)andwassupposedlyinventedata Los Alamosdinnerparty).

Finding optimal solutions in continuous spaces is the subject matter of several fields,
includingoptimizationtheory,optimalcontroltheory,andthecalculusofvariations. The
basictechniques areexplained wellby Bishop(1995);Pressetal.(2007)coverawiderange
