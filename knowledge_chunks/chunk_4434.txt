k, which is acquiring the fine motor control that the symbolic system lacks. When the network s behavior exceeds a set criterion, control of the arm is turned over to it. Ultimately, connectionists would like to see symbolic structures emerge naturally from complex interactions among simple units, in the same way that wetness emerges from the combination of hydrogen and oxygen, although it is an intrinsic property of neither. Most of the promising advantages of connectionist systems described in this section are just that: promising. A great deal of work remains to be done to turn these promises into results. Only time will tell how influential connectionist models will be in the evolution of AI research. In any case, connectionists can at least point to the brain as an existence proof that neural networks, in some form, are capable of exhibiting intelligent behavior.

If all the units are initially active, which of the four states in Fig. 18.2 will the network settle into? Implement the fixed-increment perceptron learning algorithm. Invent a three-feature linearly separable classification problem on which to test your program. Implement the backpropagation learning algorithm for a fully three-layer network. Be sure to include parameters for layer sizes, learning rate 7, number of training epochs. Test your implementation first on the OR problem: Input Vector Target Output Vector (0.0,0.0) (0,1) (0.0, 1.0) (0.9) (1.0,0.0) (0.9) (1.0,1.0) (0.9) Then on the XOR problem Input Vector Target Output Vector (0.0,0.0) (0.1) (0.0, 1.0) (0.9) (1.0,1.0) (0.9) (1.0,1.0) (0.9) Initially, use two hidden units, set 7 = 0.35, and run for 6000 training epochs. (Each epoch consists of forward and backward propagation of each of the four training examples.) Modify your program to use the momentum factor a@ = 0.9. Di
