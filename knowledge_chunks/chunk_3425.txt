 He can use a boat which will accommodate only the farmer and one possession. If the fox is left alone with the goose, the goose will be eaten. If the goose is left alone with the grain it will be eaten.. Draw a state space search tree for this puzzle using leftbank and rightbank to denote left and right river banks iespectively. 9.2. For the search tree given below, use breadth-first searching and list the elements of the queue just before selecting and expanding each next stare until a goal node is reached. (Goal states designated with .) /CN /N E F' HI LM 9.3. Repeat Problem 9.2 using a depth-first search. 9.4. Repeat Problem 9.2 using a depth-first iterative deepening search. 9.5. Describe and compare three primary uninformed search methods described in this chapter. 9.6. Show that a worst-case algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem is of exponential complexity, but an algorithm that chooses a tour through the nearest neighbor of each city is of lower order. Give an e.11ample to show the nearest neighbor algorithm is not, in general, optimal, but still often good. 9.7. Fifteen puzzle is like eight puzzle except there are fifteen tiles instead of eight. What is the branching factor of the search tree for fifteen puzzle! 9.8. Describe a problem for which means-end analysis could be successfully applied. Give an example of a few solution steps. Chap. 9 Exercises 187 9.9. Give three different heuristics for an h(n) to be used in solving the eight puzzle. 9.10. Using the search tree given below. list the elements of the queue just before the next node is expanded. Use best-first search where the numbers correspond to estimated cost-to-goal for each corresponding node. A 30 C25 I t.\ t\ I 0 22 E 19 F16 G 10 H 12 19 J7 K6 . L3 MO N4 9.11. Repeat Problem 9.10 when the cost of node B is changed to 18. 9.12. Give the time and space complexities for the search methods of Problems 9 2 and 9.3. 9.13. Discuss some of the potential problems when using bill climbing
