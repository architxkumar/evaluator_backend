delicious(biryani). The pickles are spicy. spicy(pickles). Priya relishes coffee. Telishes(priya,coffee). Priya likes food if they are delicious. likes(priya, Food) if delicious(Food). Prakash likes food if they are spicy and delicious. _ likes(prakash, Food) if spicy(Food) and delicious(Food). While the first four PROLOG equivalents are called Facts the last two conversions are termed as Rules. Food is a variable whose value is to be found from the previous facts. Also note that while variables begin with an upper case letters, the constants (eg. priya, pickles, etc.) begin with lower case letters. If we just look at the contents of the second column, you will be amazed to note that we have already written a PROLOG program to deduce what Priya and Prakash like! So here is how our first PROLOG program looks like- /* This is a program that can be used to find what a person likes*/ delicious(cakes). % Cakes are delicious. delicious(pickles). % Pickles are delicious. delicious(biryani). % Biryani is delicious, spicy(pickles). %Pickles are spicy. relishes(priya, coffee). %Priya relishes coffee. likes(priya, Food):- delicious( Food). % Priya likes food if it is delicious. likes(prakash, Food) :- spicy(Food), delicious{Food). /*Prakash likes food if it is spicy and delicious. */ Notice how the ifs have been replaced by (:-) and the ands by (commas). Also every fact such as spicy(pickles) or rule is terminated by a . (period), Comments could be of any of the following forms % This comments only this line. /* This comments everything in between the asterisks and the slashes.*/ 25.3 GOALS Now compile the program. The program is ready to accept goals which are more like queries. Suppose we wish to ask the program Which food items are delicious? This, in PROLOG terminology, is called a Goal and is presented on the ? prompt as ?- delicious(Food). Food = cakes Press ; to get the remaining alternatives for Food viz. Food = pickles; Food = biryani 498 Artificial Intelligence OEE P
