by Nilsson (1971) as an empirical measure of the efficiency; it is equivalent to assuming a
timecostof O((b )d). Fortreesearchappliedtoagraph,Korfetal.(2001)arguethatthetime
cost is better modeled as
O(bd k),
where k depends on the heuristic accuracy; this analysis
has elicited some controversy, however. For graph search, Helmert and Ro ger (2008) noted
that several well-known problems contained exponentially many nodes on optimal solution paths,implyingexponential timecomplexity for A evenwithconstant absolute errorin h. Therearemanyvariationsonthe A algorithm. Pohl(1973)proposedtheuseofdynamic
