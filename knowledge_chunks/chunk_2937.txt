One can easily imagine some future time in which such conversations with machines are
commonplace, and it becomes customary to make no linguistic distinction between real and artificial thinking. Asimilartransition occurred in theyearsafter1848,whenartificial
urea wassynthesized forthe first timeby Frederick Wo hler. Priorto this event, organic and
inorganic chemistry were essentially disjoint enterprises and many thought that no process
could existthatwouldconvert inorganic chemicals intoorganic material. Oncethesynthesis
was accomplished, chemists agreed that artificial urea was urea, because it had all the right
physical properties. Those who had posited an intrinsic property possessed by organic ma-
terial that inorganic material could never have were faced with the impossibility of devising
anytestthatcouldrevealthesupposed deficiencyofartificialurea.
For thinking, we have not yet reached our 1848 and there are those who believe that
artificialthinking,nomatterhowimpressive,willneverbereal. Forexample,thephilosopher
John Searle(1980)argues asfollows:

While it is easy to agree that computer simulations of storms do not make us wet, it is not
clear how to carry this analogy over to computer simulations of mental processes. After
all, a Hollywood simulation of
