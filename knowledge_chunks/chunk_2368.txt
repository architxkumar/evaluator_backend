as it moves along the production line, a machine randomly selects a certain percentage to
be trimmed into a square; then, each piece is wrapped in a wrapper whose color is chosen
randomly to be red or brown. 80 of the strawberry candies are round and 80 have a red
wrapper, while 90 of the anchovy candies are square and 90 have a brown wrapper. All
