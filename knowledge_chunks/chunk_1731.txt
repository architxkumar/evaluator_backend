 branching on these variables altogether by propagat-
ing information from WA and Q. A second point to notice is that after V blue, the do-
main of SA is empty. Hence, forward checking has detected that the partial assignment WA red,Q green,V blue is inconsistent with the constraints of the problem, and
thealgorithm willtherefore backtrack immediately.
For many problems the search will be more effective if we combine the MRV heuris-
tic with forward checking. Consider Figure 6.7 after assigning WA red . Intuitively, it
seems that that assignment constrains itsneighbors, NT and SA, soweshould handle those

is assigned first; then forward checking deletes red from the domains of the neighboring
variables NT and SA. After Q green is assigned, green is deleted from the domainsof

pens with MRV:NT and SAhave two values, soone of them ischosen first, then the other,
then Q, NSW, and V in order. Finally T still has three values, and any one of them works.
