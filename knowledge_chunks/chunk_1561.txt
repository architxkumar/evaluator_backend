The branching factor is about 3. (When the empty tile is in the middle, four moves are
possible; when it is in a corner, two; and when it is along an edge, three.) This means
that an exhaustive tree search to depth 22 would look at about 322 3.1 1010 states.
A graph search would cut this down by a factor of about 170,000 because only 9! 2 181,440 distinct states are reachable. (See Exercise 3.4.) This is a manageable number, but
