Besideslogicandcomputation, thethirdgreatcontribution ofmathematics to AIisthe
theory of probability. The Italian Gerolamo Cardano (1501 1576) first framed the idea of
PROBABILITY
probability, describing it in terms of the possible outcomes of gambling events. In 1654,
Blaise Pascal (1623 1662), in a letter to Pierre Fermat (1601 1665), showed how to pre-
dict the future of an unfinished gambling game and assign average payoffs to the gamblers.
Probabilityquicklybecameaninvaluable partofallthequantitative sciences, helpingtodeal
withuncertain measurements and incomplete theories. James Bernoulli (1654 1705), Pierre
Laplace (1749 1827), and others advanced the theory and introduced new statistical meth-
ods. Thomas Bayes (1702 1761), who appears on the front cover of this book, proposed
a rule for updating probabilities in the light of new evidence. Bayes rule underlies most

The science of economics got its start in 1776, when Scottish philosopher Adam Smith
(1723 1790) published An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.
Whiletheancient Greeksandothershadmadecontributions toeconomicthought,Smithwas
the first to treat it as a science, using the idea that economies can be thought of as consist-
ing of individual agents maximizing their own economic well-being. Most people think of
economics as being about money, but economists will say that they are really studying how
people makechoices thatleadtopreferred outcomes. When Mc Donald s offersahamburger
