LIGHTER(p1.p2) -. SAFE-TO-STACK(P.p yields the term LIGHTER(x,y) as a sufficient condition for inferring SAFE-TOSTACK(x,y). In a similar way LIGHTER(x.y) is regressed back through the next step to yield WEIGHT(x,w1) & WEIGHT(y.w2) & LESS(w1.w). This expression is then regressed through the final steps of the explanation structure to yield the following generalized, operational, definition of the safe-to-stack concept.
