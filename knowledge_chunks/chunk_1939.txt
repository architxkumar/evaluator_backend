mathematics (Wos and
Winker, 1983). The Boyer Moore theorem prover (Boyer and Moore, 1979) was used by
Natarajan Shankar to give the first fully rigorous formal proof of Go del s Incompleteness
Theorem (Shankar, 1986). The NUPRL system proved Girard s paradox (Howe, 1987) and
Higman s Lemma(Murthyand Russell, 1990). In1933, Herbert Robbins proposed asimple

Many early papers in mathematical logic are to be found in From Frege to Go del:
A Source Book in Mathematical Logic (van Heijenoort, 1967). Textbooks geared toward
automated deduction include the classic Symbolic Logic and Mechanical Theorem Prov-
ing(Changand Lee,1973),aswellasmorerecentworksby Duffy(1991),Wosetal.(1992),
Bibel (1993), and Kaufmann et al. (2000). The principal journal for theorem proving is the
Journal of Automated Reasoning; the main conferences are the annual Conference on Auto-
mated Deduction (CADE) and the International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning
(IJCAR). The Handbook of Automated Reasoning (Robinson and Voronkov, 2001) collects
