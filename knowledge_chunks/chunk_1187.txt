 cheapest. Figure 17.39 In the first cycle LAO expands Sj, the only node on the fringe. There are four actions a1, 213, a44 and a5 possible. Based on the costs in Figure 17.29 and the probabilities in Table 17.13, the best value that node S, gets is by action a45, marked by the solid arrows. The fringe now is S4 and Ss, and LAO will expand one of them. v"2(S,) 22.6 V5.) 17.8 Als;) 34 Figure 17.40 Expanding the fringe node Ss from Figure 17.39, there are two possible actions asgand as7. The better one increases the expected cost (value) of Ss to 17.8 and the corresponding value for S; to 24.2. LAO marks the better options as shown by solid arrows. The forward phase now leads it to the fringe nodes Sz and S3, one of which it will expand next. We assume that the node ss is picked for expansion next. The resulting graph is depicted in Figure 17.40. The two hyper-edges emanating from ss, correspond to the two actions asg and as7, both leading to nodes sg and s7, but with different probabilities. The heuristic values are h(Sg) 0 and h(s7) 34 obtained, again, by finding the deterministic least cost. The estimate of s7 may seem high, but one must remember that it is a long way from the goal node. The actual value is likely to be higher still. The best value for node ss comes, not surprisingly, from action asg and results in a value of 17.8, which is greater than the heuristic estimate of 15. This has to be propagated back into Gp and results in a revised value V 215:257(s,) 24.8 for the start node. This revised value is not the lowest now. The lowest value is V 212(s,) 22.6 corresponding to the action aj. The new Fringe is shown by the dark solid nodes, sz and s3. LAO will next pick one of them. We will leave the action at this stage. The process of adding new nodes will continue. After (say) so is expanded one more, the node sg will join the fray too. Then depending upon which partial policy looks better, AO will continue expanding the fringe nodes till it has the solution
