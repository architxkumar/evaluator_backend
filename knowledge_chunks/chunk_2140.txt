But de Finetti proved something much stronger: If Agent 1 expresses a set of degrees
of belief that violate the axioms of probability theory then there is a combination of bets by
Agent 2that guarantees that Agent 1 will lose money every time. Forexample, suppose that

2 chooses to bet 4 on a, 3 on b, and 2 on (a b), then Agent 1 always loses money,
regardless of the outcomes for a and b. De Finetti s theorem implies that no rational agent
canhavebeliefsthatviolatetheaxiomsofprobability.

One common objection to de Finetti s theorem is that this betting game is rather con-
trived. Forexample, what ifone refuses to bet? Does that end the argument? Theansweris
that the betting game is an abstract model for the decision-making situation in which every
agent is unavoidably involved at every moment. Every action (including inaction) is a kind
ofbet, andeveryoutcome canbeseenasapayoff ofthebet. Refusing tobetislikerefusing
