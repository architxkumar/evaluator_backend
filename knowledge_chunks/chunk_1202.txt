the time intervals your local news channel allocates to content. The rest of the time is devoted to advertisements. Assuming that we count time in minutes, the content durations are ( 0,7 , 10, 13 , 17, 20 , 21, 22 ) and similarly the next 30 minutes. The intervening gaps between the shaded areas are of 3, 4, 1 and 8 minutes every half an hour. Assuming that you switch on the television and are confronted with an advertisement, what is the likelihood that the time is in the interval of 8 minutes, starting at 22 minutes past the hour? Figure 17.44 The shaded areas show the time interval when content is broadcast every hour. 26. Consider the transition graph in Figure 17.37. Consider it to be an indefinite horizon MDP with the following reward structure R(sg) 100, R(sg) -100 and all other states having zero reward. Let the costs of moves and probabilities be defined as the problem as 17.13. Pose the above problem as an SSP. 27. Consider the following stochastic shortest path problem described in (Hansen and Zilberstein, 2001). Figure 17.45 depicts a grid world in which the agent has to move from square 1 to square 4. The moves available are Up, Down, Left, and Right. Each move is applicable, if there exists a square in the direction of the move. Each move succeeds with a probability 0.5 and cost 1. Draw the transition graph for the above problem and show how LAO will solve it. Caution: Treat self-loops carefully during cost revision. 28. The Coverup Bureau said that either Mr. K or Mr. Y had stolen the goods. Its chief said he was 70 sure of it. The Cocktail Circuit said with 50 confidence that Mr. C had done no wrong. The Jumbo Circus claimed that it was either Mr. K or Mr. R with 80 certainty. If you were to believe in what they said, who according to you is the prime culprit, and what is your degree of belief in your conclusion? What is the confidence interval supporting the statement It was either Mr. Y or Mr. R ? Justify all your answers. 29. Sherlock brooded ove
