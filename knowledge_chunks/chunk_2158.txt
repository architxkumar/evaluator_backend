calculation, which the reader might wish to perform, shows that 2,2 contains a pit with
roughly 86 probability. The wumpus agent should definitely avoid 2,2 ! Note that our

What this section has shown is that even seemingly complicated problems can be for-
mulated precisely in probability theory and solved with simple algorithms. To get efficient
solutions, independence and conditional independence relationships can be used to simplify
the summations required. These relationships often correspond to ournatural understanding
ofhowtheproblemshouldbedecomposed. Inthenextchapter, wedevelopformalrepresen-
tations for such relationships as well as algorithms that operate on those representations to
perform probabilistic inference efficiently.
