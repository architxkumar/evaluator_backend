9.17 This exercise looks at the recursive application of rewrite rules, using logic program-
ming. Arewriterule(ordemodulatorin OTTER terminology)isanequationwithaspecified

matchesx 0withtheexpressionx. Rewriterulesareakeycomponentofequationalreason-

9.18 This exercise considers the implementation of search algorithms in Prolog. Suppose
that successor(X,Y)is true when state Y is a successor of state X; and that goal(X)
