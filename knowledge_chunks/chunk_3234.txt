th little or no data typing and dynamic memory management. There are several dialects of LISP i chding FRANZLISP, INTERLISP. MACLISP, QLISP. SCHEME, and COMMON LISP. The COMMON LISP version is a recent attempt to standardize the language to make it more portable and easier to maintain. LISP has become the language of choice for most Al practitioners. It was practically unheard of outside the research community until Al began to gain some popularity ten to fifteen years ago. Since then, special LISP processing machines have been built and its popularity has spread to many new sectors of business and government. In this chapter we give a summary of the important features of LISP and briefly introduce PROLOG and other Al languages. 3.1 INTRODUCTION TO LISP: SYNTAX AND NUMERIC FUNCTIONS The basic building blocks of LISP are the atom, list, and the string. An atom is a number or string of contiguous characters, including numbers and special characters. A list, is a sequence of atoms and/or other lists enclosed within parentheses.

Thus, the top elements of the list (a b (C d) e (f)) are a, b, (c d), e, and (f). The elements c and d are top elements of the sublist (c d). Atoms, lists, and strings are the only valid objects in LISP They are called symbol
