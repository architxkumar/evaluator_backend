such loopy paths means that the complete search tree for Romania is infinite because there
LOOPYPATH
is no limit to how often one can traverse a loop. On the other hand, the state space the

costs are additive and step costs are nonnegative, a loopy path to any given state is never

about reaching the goal, there s never any reason to keep more than one path to any given
state, because any goal state that is reachable by extending one path is also reachable by
extending theother.
In some cases, it is possible to define the problem itself so as to eliminate redundant
paths. Forexample, if we formulate the 8-queens problem (page 71) so that a queen can be
placedinanycolumn,theneachstatewithnqueenscanbereachedbyn!differentpaths;but
