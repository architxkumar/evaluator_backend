us, special-purpose logics givecertain kinds ofobjects (andtheaxioms about them) first
class status within the logic, rather than simply defining them within the knowledge base.
HIGHER-ORDER Higher-order logic views the relations and functions referred to by first-order logic as ob-

logics, higher-order logic is strictly more expressive than first-order logic, in the sense that

EPISTEMOLOGICAL A logic can also be characterized by its epistemological commitments the possible

states of knowledge that it allows with respect to each fact. In both propositional and first-
orderlogic, asentence represents afactand theagent eitherbelieves thesentence tobetrue,
believes it to be false, or has no opinion. These logics therefore have three possible states
ofknowledge regarding anysentence. Systemsusing probability theory,ontheotherhand,
