19.5.4 Making discoveries withinductive logicprogramming
Aninverse resolution procedure that inverts a complete resolution strategy is, in principle, a
complete algorithm for learning first-order theories. That is, if some unknown Hypothesis
generates a set of examples, then an inverse resolution procedure can generate Hypothesis
from the examples. This observation suggests an interesting possibility: Suppose that the
available examples include avariety oftrajectories offalling bodies. Wouldaninverse reso-
lutionprogrambetheoretically capableofinferringthelawofgravity? Theanswerisclearly
yes,becausethelawofgravityallowsonetoexplaintheexamples,givensuitablebackground
