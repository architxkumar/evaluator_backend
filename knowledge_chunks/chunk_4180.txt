opped off the stack. The next element on the stack is the combined goal representing all of the preconditions for UNSTACK(B, A). We check to make sure it is satisfied in the world model. It will be unless we undid one of its components in attempting to satisfy another. In this case, there is no problem and the combined goal can be popped from the stack. Now the top element of the stack is the operator UNSTACK(B, A). We are now guaranteed that its preconditions are satisfied, so it can be applied to produce a new world model from which the rest of the problem-solving process can continue. This is done using the ADD and DELETE lists specified for UNSTACK. Meanwhile we record that UNSTACK(B, A) is the first operator of the proposed solution sequence. At this point, the database corresponding to the world model is ONTABLE(A) \ ONTABLE(C) \ ONTABLE(D) A HOLDING(B) A CLEAR(A) The goal stack now is HOLDING(C) CLEAR(A) A HOLDING(C) STACK(C, A) ONG, D) ON(C, A) A ON(B, D) A OTAD We now attempt to satisfy the goal HOLDING(C). There are two operators that might make HOLDING(C) true: PICKUP(C) and UNSTACK(C, x), where x could be any block from which C could be unstacked. 258 Artificial Intelligence Without looking ahead, we cannot tell which of these operators is appropriate, so we create two branches of the search tree, corresponding to the following goal stacks: ONTABLE(C) ON(C, x) CLEAR(C) CLEAR(C) ARMEMPTY ARMEMPTY ONTABLE(C) A CLEAR(C) A ON(C, x) A CLEAR(C) A ARMEMPTY ARMEMPTY PICKUP(C) UNSTACK(C, x) CLEAR(A) A HOLDING(C) CLEAR(A) A HOLDING(C) STACK(C, A) STACK(G, A) ON@, D) ON(B, D) ON(C, A) A ON(B, D) A OTAD ON(C, A) A ON(B, D) A OTAD O) P] Notice that for alternative 2, the goal stack now contains a variable x, which appears in three places. Although any block could be substituted for x, it is important that the same one be matched to each of the x s. Thus it is important that each time a variable is introduced into the goal stack, it be given a name distinct from any o
