Manna and Richard Waldinger (1971) for reasoning about programs and later by Michael
Genesereth (1984) for reasoning about circuits. In Europe, logic programming (a restricted
formoffirst-orderreasoning) wasdevelopedforlinguistic analysis(Colmerauer etal.,1973)
and for general declarative systems (Kowalski, 1974). Computational logic was also well
entrenchedat Edinburghthroughthe LCF(Logicfor Computable Functions)project(Gordon
etal.,1979). Thesedevelopments arechronicled furtherin Chapters9and12.
Practical applications built with first-order logic include a system for evaluating the
manufacturing requirementsforelectronicproducts(Mannion,2002),asystemforreasoning
about policies for fileaccess and digital rights management (Halpern and Weissman, 2008),
andasystemfortheautomatedcomposition of Webservices (Mc Ilraithand Zeng,2001).
Reactions to the Whorf hypothesis (Whorf, 1956) and the problem of language and
thoughtingeneral,appearinseveralrecentbooks(Gumperz and Levinson,1996;Bowerman
and Levinson,2001;Pinker,2003;Gentnerand Goldin-Meadow,2003). The theory theory
(Gopnik and Glymour, 2002; Tenenbaum et al., 2007) views children s learning about the
world as analogous to the construction of scientific theories. Just as the predictions of a
machine learning algorithm depend strongly on the vocabulary supplied to it, so will the
child sformulationoftheoriesdependonthelinguisticenvironmentinwhichlearningoccurs.
There are a number of good introductory texts on first-order logic, including some by
leading figures in the history of logic: Alfred Tarski (1941), Alonzo Church (1956), and
