ntage comes from the
abilityofcrossovertocombinelargeblocksoflettersthat haveevolvedindependently toper-
form useful functions, thus raising the level of granularity at which the search operates. For
example,itcouldbethatputtingthefirstthreequeensinpositions 2,4,and6(wheretheydo
not attack each other) constitutes a useful block that can be combined with other blocks to
construct asolution.
The theory of genetic algorithms explains how this works using the idea of a schema,
SCHEMA
which is a substring in which some of the positions can be left unspecified. For example,
the schema 246 describes all 8-queens states in which the first three queens are in
positions 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Strings that match the schema (such as 24613578) are
calledinstancesoftheschema. Itcanbeshownthatiftheaveragefitnessoftheinstances of
