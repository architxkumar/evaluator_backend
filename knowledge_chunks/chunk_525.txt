ly be assumed to have value true, or they can be considered to have a value nit for an initial action that generates the starting state (in the style of plan space planning see Chapter 7).

The mutex relations are implemented as constraints. Since actions are not variables but values of variables, action mutexes are modelled as constraints between the corresponding proposition variables. If two actions in a layer are mutex then two propositions in that layer cannot simultaneously take those actions as values. For example, the actions PkUp(C) and UnSt(A, B) are mutex in action layer A, in the figure. This means that Hold,(C) PkUp(C) and Hold,(A) UnSt(A, B) cannot hold together, and likewise Hold,(C) PkUp(C) and Clear,(B) UnSt(A, B). This is modelled in GP-CSP as, Hold,(C) PkUp(C) Hold,(A) UnSK(A, B) and, Hold,(C) PkUp(C) Clear,(B) UnStA, B) The remaining action mutexes in the problem of 10.4 are left as an exercise for the reader. The dynamic CSP starts of with an initial set of constraints derived from the goal propositions. These constraints say that the goal propositions are active. Initial State Active On2(A, C),
