riptions are put on a consistent list. Any descriptors remaining are specialized by appending selectors from the original list. These modified descriptions are tested for coisistency and completeness and the process is repeated until predefined list size limits are exceeded or until all descriptors have been put on either the solutions or the consistent list. S. Each of the descriptors on the consistent list is made more generic using generalizations such as climbing a generalization tree or closing an interval. The generalizations are then ranked and pruned using a Lexicographic Evaluttion Function (LEF) and the best m of these are chosen as the description. The LEF uses criteria established by the user such as maximum examples covered, simplest decriptions (fewest terms), or user defined least cost. The final descriptions on the solutions list are the induced (generalized) descriptions which cover all the training instances. The following example will illustrate this process. Assume the following three descriptions have been given for the object instances displayed in Figure 19.7. 30.0.
