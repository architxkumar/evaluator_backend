The principle of indifference attributed to Laplace (1816) states that propo-
sitions that are syntactically symmetric with respect to the evidence should be
accorded equal probability. Various refinements have been proposed, culminating
in the attempt by Carnap and others to develop a rigorous inductive logic, capa-
bleofcomputingthecorrectprobabilityforanyproposition fromanycollectionof
observations. Currently, itisbelieved thatno unique inductive logic exists; rather,
any such logic rests on a subjective prior probability distribution whose effect is
diminished asmoreobservations arecollected.

One particularly common task is to extract the distribution over some subset of variables or
a single variable. Forexample, adding the entries in the first row gives the unconditional or
