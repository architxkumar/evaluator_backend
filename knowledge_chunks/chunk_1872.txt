tle s logic deals with generalizations over objects, it fell far short of the ex-

systematic treatment of relations was given by Augustus De Morgan (1864), who cited the
followingexampletoshowthesortsofinferencesthat Aristotle slogiccouldnothandle: All
horses are animals; therefore, the head of a horse is the head of an animal. This inference
is inaccessible to Aristotle because any valid rule that can support this inference must first

first-order logic independently of Frege, although slightly later. Frege s ability to nest quan-
tifiers was a big step forward, but he used an awkward notation. The present notation for
first-order logic isduesubstantially to Giuseppe Peano (1889), but thesemantics isvirtually
identicalto Frege s. Oddlyenough,Peano saxiomsweredueinlargemeasureto Grassmann
