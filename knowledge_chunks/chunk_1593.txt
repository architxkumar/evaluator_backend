The success of hill climbing depends very much on the shape of the state-space land-
scape: if there are few local maxima and plateaux, random-restart hill climbing will find a
good solution very quickly. On the other hand, many real problems have a landscape that

4.1.2 Simulated annealing
Ahill-climbingalgorithmthatnevermakes downhill movestowardstateswithlowervalue
(or higher cost) is guaranteed to be incomplete, because it can get stuck on a local maxi-
mum. In contrast, a purely random walk that is, moving to a successor chosen uniformly
at random from the set of successors is complete but extremely inefficient. Therefore, it
