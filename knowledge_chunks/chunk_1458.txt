e time foran Aplysia neuron is roughly the same
as fora human neuron, how does the computational power, in terms of memory updates per
second, comparewiththehigh-end computerdescribed in Figure1.3?

1.6 How could introspection reporting on one s inner thoughts be inaccurate? Could I
bewrongaboutwhat I mthinking? Discuss.

1.8 Many of the computational models of cognitive activities that have been proposed in-
volve quite complex mathematical operations, such asconvolving animage witha Gaussian
orfindingaminimumoftheentropyfunction. Mosthumans(andcertainlyallanimals)never
learn this kind of mathematics at all, almost no one learns it before college, and almost no
one can compute the convolution of a function with a Gaussian in their head. What sense
does it make to say that the vision system is doing this kind of mathematics, whereas the
actualpersonhasnoideahowtodoit?
