thing and this must be changed. The resultant general boundary G, is shown below. Observe that it says yes to every pattern, except the first training example. That is, for every other pattern, there exists some hypothesis in G, that says yes. G, M,?,2 , H,?,2 , ?,B,2 , ?, M,? , ?,2, Y S, O, , D The next example, also negative, is Abdul with the pattern L,M,Y . The specific boundary is not affected, as in the previous case. But there are hypotheses in the general boundary ?, M,? and ?,?,Y that would have said yes to the second example, and must be removed. Each inconsistent hypothesis that is removed from G must be replaced by specializations that say no to the example. Replacing them we get, G , M,?,? , H,?,2 , ?,B,2 , M, M,? , H.M,? , ?, M, N , M,?, Y , H,?,Y , ?,B,Y , ?.P,Y S, O, , O However, the resulting set G', contains hypotheses that are less general than others in the set. For example, M, M,? g M,?,? and M, M,? must be removed. So also H,M,? , M,?,Y , H,?,Y and ?, B, Y . After removing them we have the boundaries, G, M,?,? , H,?,? , ?, B,2 , ?, M, N , ?, P, Y S, O, O, O The next example is Abheek with M,M,N and is also a negative example. The readers should verify that this leads to the following boundary sets. G; M, P, ? , M,?, Y , H,?,2 , ?, B,? , L, M, N , ?, P, Y S3 O, , O Let us skip to a positive example next for the purpose of illustration. Consider Adrian with the pattern M, P, Y . There are three hypotheses in G3 H,?,? , ?, B,? and L, M, N that would have said no this training instance, and must be removed. At the same time, the specific boundary must now be generalized to recognize this instance. The resulting boundary sets are, G, M, P,? , M,?, Y , ?, R, Y S, M, P, Y The next positive example Agnar has the same pattern as Abheek and does not result in any change. The one after that is Ahneta with the pattern H, B, Y . None of the hypotheses in G4 recognize this pattern, and all of them say no to this example, and consequently must be removed. The
