ent. Tf existential quantifiers occur within the scope of universal quantifiers, then the value that satisfies the predicate may depend on the values of the universally quantified variables. For example, in the formula Vx: dy -father-of (x) the value of y that satisfies father-of depends on the particular value of x. Thus we must generate functions with the same number of arguments as the number of universal quantifiers in whose scope the expression occurs. So this example would be transformed into Vx : father-of(S2(x),x)) These generated functions are called Skolem functions. Sometimes ones with no arguments are called Skolem constants. . Drop the prefix. At this point, all remaining variables are universally quantified, so the prefix can just be dropped and any proof procedure we use can simply assume that any variable it sees is universally quantified. Now the formula produced in step 4 appears as [ARoman(x) VV aknow(x, Marcus)) Vv [hate(x, Caesar) \/ (shate(y, 2) thinkcrazy{x, y))} . Convert the matrix into a conjunction of disjuncts. In the case of our example, since there are no and s, it is only necessary to exploit the associative property of or [i.e., (a A b) ye = (ac) A(B Ac)) and simply remove the parentheses, giving a Roman(x) \/ mknow(x, Marcus) \/ hate(x, Caesar) \/ shate(y, 2) \/ thinkcrazy(x, y) However, it is also frequently necessary to exploit the distributive property [i.e., (a A 6) vc =(av c) A (b\/ c)|. For example, the formula (winter \ wearingboots) \y (summer /\ wearingsandals) becomes, after one application of the rule [winter \/ (summer \ wearingsandals)] /\ [wearingboots \/ (summer /\ wearingsandals)) and then, after a second application, required since there are still conjuncts joined by OR s, (winter \y summer) /\ (winter \V wearingsandals) (wearingboots \/ summer) (wearingboots \/ wearingsandals) . Create a separate clause corresponding to each conjunct. In order for a wff to be true, all the clauses that are generated from it must be
