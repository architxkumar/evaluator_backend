Thewidespread growthof applications toreal-world problems caused aconcurrent in-
crease in the demands for workable knowledge representation schemes. A large number
of different representation and reasoning languages were developed. Some were based on
logic forexample,the Prologlanguage becamepopularin Europe,andthe PLANNER fam-
ily in the United States. Others, following Minsky s idea of frames (1975), adopted a more

assure national competitiveness. In both cases, AI was part of a broad effort, including chip
