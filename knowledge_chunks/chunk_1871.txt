8.5 SUMMARY
Thischapterhasintroduced first-orderlogic,arepresentationlanguagethatisfarmorepow-
erfulthanpropositional logic. Theimportantpointsareas follows: Knowledge representation languages should be declarative, compositional, expressive,
contextindependent, andunambiguous. Logics differ in their ontological commitments and epistemological commitments.
Whilepropositional logiccommitsonlytotheexistence offacts, first-orderlogiccom-
mitstotheexistence ofobjects andrelationsandthereby gainsexpressivepower. The syntax of first-order logic builds on that of propositional logic. It adds terms to
represent objects, and has universal and existential quantifiers to construct assertions
aboutallorsomeofthepossible valuesofthequantifiedvariables. Apossibleworld,ormodel,forfirst-orderlogicincludes asetofobjectsandan inter-
