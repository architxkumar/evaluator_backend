One sfirstinclinationmightbetoproposethatallboardstatesinthecurrentbeliefstate
are equally likely but this can t be right. Consider, for example, White s belief state after
Black s first move of the game. By definition (assuming that Black plays optimally), Black

goal is not just to move pieces tothe right squares but also tominimize the information that
the opponent has about their location. Playing any predictable optimal strategy provides
the opponent with information. Hence, optimal play in partially observable games requires
a willingness to play somewhat randomly. (This is why restaurant hygiene inspectors do
