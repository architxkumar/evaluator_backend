16.1 COMBINING BELIEFS AND DESIRES UNDER UNCERTAINTY
Decision theory, initssimplest form, deals withchoosing among actions based on thedesir-
abilityoftheirimmediateoutcomes; thatis,theenvironment isassumedtobeepisodic inthe
sense defined on page 43. (Thisassumption isrelaxed in Chapter 17.) In Chapter3weused
the notation RESULT(s
0
,a) for the state that is the deterministic outcome of taking action a
in state s . In this chapter wedeal withnondeterministic partially observable environments.

thing, but goes only a small distance toward a f
