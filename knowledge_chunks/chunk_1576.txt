andmetalevellearning. The MA algorithm appeared in Chakrabarti et al. (1989). SMA, or Simplified MA, emergedfromanattempttoimplement MA asacomparisonalgorithmfor IE(Russell,1992). Kaindland Khorsand (1994) have applied SMA toproduce abidirectional search algorithm

search and a strategy for switching to breadth-first search to increase memory-efficiency
(Zhouand Hansen,2006). Korf(1995)surveysmemory-bounded searchtechniques.
Theideathatadmissibleheuristics canbederivedbyproblem relaxation appearsinthe
seminal paper by Held and Karp (1970), who used the minimum-spanning-tree heuristic to
solvethe TSP.(See Exercise3.30.)
The automation of the relaxation process was implemented successfully by Priedi-
tis (1993), building on earlier work with Mostow (Mostow and Prieditis, 1989). Holte and
Hernadvolgyi (2001) describe morerecent steps towardsautomating theprocess. Theuseof
pattern databases to derive admissible heuristics is due to Gasser (1995) and Culberson and
Schaeffer (1996, 1998); disjoint pattern databases are described by Korf and Felner (2002);
a similar method using symbolic patterns is due to Edelkamp (2009). Felner et al. (2007)
show how to compress pattern databases to save space. The probabilistic interpretation of
heuristics wasinvestigated indepthby Pearl(1984)and Hanssonand Mayer(1989).
By far the most comprehensive source on heuristics and heuristic search algorithms
is Pearl s (1984) Heuristics text. This book provides especially good coverage of the wide varietyofoffshootsandva
