Even the most efficient solution algorithm is not of much use when no solutions exist.
Many things just cannot be done without sensing. For example, the sensorless 8-puzzle is
impossible. On the other hand, a little bit of sensing can go a long way. Forexample, every

of detecting dirt in other squares. The formal problem specification includes a PERCEPT(s)
function that returns the percept received in a given state. (If sensing is nondeterministic,
thenweusea PERCEPTS functionthatreturnsasetofpossiblepercepts.) Forexample,inthe
local-sensingvacuumworld,the PERCEP Tinstate1is A,Dirty . Fullyobservableproblems
are aspecial case in which PERCEPT(s) sforevery state s, whilesensorless problems are
aspecialcaseinwhich PERCEPT(s) null.
Whenobservations are partial, itwillusually be the case that several states could have
produced any given percept. For example, the percept A,Dirty is produced by state 3 as
well as by state 1. Hence, given this as the initial percept, the initial belief state for the
local-sensing vacuum world will be 1,3 . The ACTIONS, STEP-COST, and GOAL-TEST
