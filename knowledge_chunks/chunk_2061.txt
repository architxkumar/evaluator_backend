tionalissuecanbefinessedorbrushed underthecarpet. In any sufficiently demanding domain, different areas of knowledge must be unified,
because reasoning and problem solving could involve several areas simultaneously. A

We should say up front that the enterprise of general ontological engineering has so far had
only limited success. None of the top AI applications (as listed in Chapter 1) make use
of a shared ontology they all use special-purpose knowledge engineering. Social political
considerations can make it difficult for competing parties to agree on an ontology. As Tom
Gruber (2004) says, Every ontology is a treaty a social agreement among people with
some common motive in sharing. When competing concerns outweigh the motivation for
sharing, therecanbenocommonontology. Thoseontologies thatdoexisthavebeencreated

2. Byimporting categories, attributes, and values from an existing database ordatabases.
DBPEDIA wasbuiltbyimportingstructured factsfrom Wikipedia (Bizeretal.,2007).
3. Byparsing text documents and extracting information from them. TEXTRUNNER was
builtbyreadingalargecorpusof Webpages(Bankoand Etzioni,2008).
4. By enticing unskilled amateurs to enter commonsense knowledge. The OPENMIND
system was built by volunteers who proposed facts in English (Singh et al., 2002;
Chklovskiand Gil,2005).
