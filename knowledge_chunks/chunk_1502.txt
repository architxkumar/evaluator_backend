Goals, furtheranalyzed as desires (general) and intentions (currently pursued), arecentral to
the theory of agents developed by Bratman (1987). This theory has been influential both in

Horvitz et al. (1988) specifically suggest the use of rationality conceived as the maxi-

and decision making under uncertainty was probably the single biggest factor in the rapid
shifttowardsutility-based agentsinthe1990s(see Part IV).
