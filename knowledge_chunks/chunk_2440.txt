(non-zero-sum) games. Hisdefinition ofanequilibrium solution, although originating inthe
work of Cournot (1838), became known as Nash equilibrium. After a long delay because
oftheschizophrenia hesuffered from 1959 onward, Nashwasawarded the Nobel Memorial
Prizein Economics(alongwith Reinhart Seltenand John Harsanyi)in1994. The Bayes Nash
equilibrium is described by Harsanyi (1967) and discussed by Kadane and Larkey (1982).

The prisoner s dilemma was invented as a classroom exercise by Albert W. Tucker in
1950(basedonanexampleby Merrill Floodand Melvin Dresher)andiscoveredextensively
by Axelrod (1985) and Poundstone (1993). Repeated games were introduced by Luce and
Raiffa(1957), and gamesofpartial information inextensive form by Kuhn(1953). Thefirst
practical algorithm for sequential, partial-information games was developed within AI by
Kolleretal. (1996); the paper by Kollerand Pfeffer(1997) provides a readable introduction
tothefieldanddescribeaworkingsystemforrepresenting andsolving sequential games.
The use of abstraction to reduce a game tree to a size that can be solved with Koller s
technique is discussed by Billings et al. (2003). Bowling et al. (2008) show how to use
importance sampling to get a better estimate of the value of a strategy. Waugh et al. (2009)
showthattheabstractionapproachisvulnerabletomakingsystematicerrorsinapproximating
the equilibrium solution, meaning that the whole approach is on shaky ground: it works for
some games but not others. Korb et al. (1999) experiment with an opponent model in the
form of a Bayesian network. It plays five-card stud about as well as experienced humans.
(Zinkevich et al., 2008) show how an approach that minimizes regret can find approximate
equilibria forabstractions with 1012 states,100timesmorethanpreviousmethods.
