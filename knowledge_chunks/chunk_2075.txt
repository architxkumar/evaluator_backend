time scale for a moment. The function Duration gives the difference between the end time
andthestarttime.
Interval(i) Duration(i) (Time(End(i)) Time(Begin(i))).
Time(Begin(AD1900)) Seconds(0).
Time(Begin(AD2001)) Seconds(3187324800).
Time(End(AD2001)) Seconds(3218860800).
Duration(AD2001) Seconds(31536000).
To make these numbers easier to read, we also introduce a function Date, which takes six
arguments (hours, minutes,seconds, day,month,andyear)andreturnsatimepoint:
Time(Begin(AD2001)) Date(0,0,0,1,Jan,2001)
Date(0,20,21,24,1,1995) Seconds(3000000000).

These all have their intuitive meaning, with the exception of Overlap: we tend to think of
overlap as symmetric (if i overlaps j then j overlaps i), but in this definition, Overlap(i,j)

12.3.3 Fluents and objects
Physical objects can be viewed as generalized events, in the sense that a physical object is
a chunk of space time. For example, USA can be thought of as an event that began in,
say, 1776 as a union of 13 states and is still in progress today as a un
