ructure into the story representation by means of the request that was active and looking for a plan. It then activates the three requests shown as suggestions. Two of these use FOCUS-REQ to find their data the planner and the restaurant and move it to the respective gaps. The action gap is filled by the pattern that triggered the rule. The remaining gap for SUB-EPISODES is unfilled and PAM will wait for more sentences that it will try and fit into this gap and others that may be created in the process. At this point, the story representation it has created is shown in Figure 14.17 below.

There is an unfilled gap for SUBEPISODES. PAM would attempt to connect any subsequent sentences to this gap. The ability of a program to understand a story, in the sense of being able to answer questions about it, depends upon the knowledge it has. The more the number of Scripts a system has, the more the number of stereotyped situations it will be able to recognize quickly. The more the number of Goals, Plans, Actions and the relations between them it knows, the more diverse the stories in which the program will be able to connect sentences by coherently. Schank and Abelson (1977) have identified the following different kinds of goals. Satisfaction goals like S-HUNGER, S-SEX and S-SLEEP. These are recurring biological needs of humans. Enjoyment goals like E-TREKKING, E-MUSIC and E-BRIDGE. Activities that are optionally pursued by people for enjoyment. . Achievement goals like A-SKILL, A-GOOD-JOB and APOSSESSIONS. These are long-term goals that someone may want to achieve. Preservation goals like P-HEALTH and P-REPUTATION. These are goals that crop up when something is threatened. Crisis goals are special class of P-goals that might need drastic actio
