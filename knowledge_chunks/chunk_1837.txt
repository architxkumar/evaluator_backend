First-order logic can also express facts about some orall of theobjects inthe universe. This
enables one to represent general laws or rules, such as the statement Squares neighboring

COMMITMENT
Mathematically, this commitmentisexpressed through thenature oftheformal modelswith
respect to which the truth of sentences is defined. Forexample, propositional logic assumes
that there are facts that either hold or do not hold in the world. Each fact can be in one
of two states: true or false, and each model assigns true or false to each proposition sym-
bol (see Section 7.4.2).2 First-order logic assumes more; namely, that the world consists of
objects with certain relations among them that do or do not hold. The formal models are
correspondingly morecomplicatedthanthoseforpropositional logic. Special-purpose logics
make still further ontological commitments; forexample, temporal logic assumes that facts

hold at particular times and that those times (which may be points or intervals) are ordered.
Thus, special-purpose logics givecertain kinds ofobjects (andtheaxioms about them) first
class status within the logic, rather than simply defining them within the knowledge base.
