to use with . Using as the main connective with led to an overly strong statement in
theexample inthe previous section; using with usually leads toavery weakstatement,
indeed. Considerthefollowingsentence: x Crown(x) On Head(x,John).
On the surface, this might look like a reasonable rendition of our sentence. Applying the
semantics, weseethatthesentence saysthatatleastoneofthefollowingassertions istrue:
Richardthe Lionheartisacrown Richardthe Lionheart ison John shead;
King Johnisacrown King Johnison John s head;
Richard sleftlegisacrown Richard sleftlegison John shead;
andsoon. Nowanimplicationistrueifbothpremiseandconclusionaretrue,orifitspremise
is false. So if Richard the Lionheart is not a crown, then the first assertion is true and the
existential is satisfied. So, an existentially quantified implication sentence is true whenever

Nestedquantifiers
We will often want to express more complex sentences using multiple quantifiers. The sim-
plestcaseiswherethequantifiers areofthesametype. Forexample, Brothersaresiblings canbewrittenas x y Brother(x,y) Sibling(x,y).

Consecutive quantifiers of the same type can be written as one quantifier with several vari-
ables. Forexample,tosaythatsiblinghood isasymmetricrelationship, wecanwrite x,y Sibling(x,y) Sibling(y,x).
In other cases we will have mixtures. Everybody loves somebody means that for every
person, thereissomeonethatpersonloves: x y Loves(x,y).
Ontheotherhand,tosay Thereissomeonewhoislovedbyeveryone, wewrite y x Loves(x,y).
