11.3.2 Contingent planning
We saw in Chapter 4 that contingent planning the generation of plans with conditional
branchingbasedonpercepts isappropriateforenvironmentswithpartialobservability,non-
determinism, orboth. Forthepartially observable painting problem withthepercept axioms
givenearlier, onepossible contingent solution isasfollows: Look At(Table),Look At(Chair),
if Color(Table,c) Color(Chair,c)then No Op
else Remove Lid(Can ),Look At(Can ),Remove Lid(Can ),Look At(Can ),
1 1 2 2
if Color(Table,c) Color(can,c)then Paint(Chair,can)
elseif Color(Chair,c) Color(can,c)then Paint(Table,can)
else Paint(Chair,Can ),Paint(Table,Can ) 1 1
Variables in this plan should be considered existentially quantified; the second line says
that if there exists some color c that is the color of the table and the chair, then the agent
need not do anything to achieve the goal. When executing this plan, a contingent-planning
agent can maintain its belief state as a logical formula and evaluate each branch condition
by determining if the belief state entails the condition formula or its negation. (It is up to
the contingent-planning algorithm to make sure that the agent will never end up in a be-
lief state where the condition formula s truth value is unknown.) Note that with first-order
conditions, the formula may be satisfied in more than one way; for example, the condition
Color(Table,c) Color(can,c)mightbesatisfiedby can Can andby can Can if
1 2
both cans are the same color as the table. In that case, the agent can choose any satisfying
substitution toapplytotherestoftheplan.
