Conceptof Rationality 37
We answer this age-old question in an age-old way: by considering the consequences
of the agent s behavior. When an agent is plunked down in an environment, it generates a
sequenceofactionsaccordingtotheperceptsitreceives. Thissequenceofactionscausesthe
environment to go through a sequence of states. If the sequence is desirable, then the agent
PERFORMANCE has performed well. This notion of desirability is captured by aperformance measure that

evaluatesanygivensequence ofenvironment states.
Notice that we said environment states, not agent states. If we define success in terms
of agent s opinion ofits own performance, an agent could achieve perfect rationality simply
bydeluding itselfthatitsperformance wasperfect. Humanagentsinparticular arenotorious
for sour grapes believing they did not really want something (e.g., a Nobel Prize) after
notgettingit.

Consider, for example, the vacuum-cleaner agent from the preceding section. We might
proposetomeasureperformancebytheamountofdirtcleaned upinasingleeight-hourshift.
With a rational agent, of course, what you ask for is what you get. A rational agent can

at each time step (perhaps with a penalty for electricity consumed and noise generated). As
a general rule, it is better to design performance measures according to what one actually
wantsintheenvironment, ratherthanaccording tohowonethinkstheagentshouldbehave.

For example, the notion of clean floor in the preceding paragraph is based on average
cleanliness over time.
