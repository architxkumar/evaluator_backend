For example, the notion of clean floor in the preceding paragraph is based on average
cleanliness over time. Yet the same average cleanliness can be achieved by two different

in fact it is a deep philosophical question with far-reaching implications. Which is better a reckless life of highs and lows, or a safe but humdrum existence? Which is better an

That depends! First, we need to say what the performance measure is, what is known about
theenvironment, andwhatsensorsandactuators theagenthas. Letusassumethefollowing: The performance measure awards one point for each clean square at each time step,
overa lifetime of1000timesteps. The geography of the environment is known a priori (Figure 2.2) but the dirt distri-
