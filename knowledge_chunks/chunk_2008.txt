of actions, each of which may be an HLA or a primitive action (which has no refinements
by definition). For example, the action Go to San Francisco airport, represented formally
as Go(Home,SFO), might have two possible refinements, as shown in Figure 11.4. The
same figure shows a recursive refinement for navigation in the vacuum world: to get to a
