nspecting the memoized memory mem maintained by ExtractPlan. Given the set of predicates (:predicates (clear ?b) (on-table ?b) (empty ?h) (holding ?h ?b) (on ?b1 ?b2) (hand 7h) (block ?b)) in untyped pddi, define the actions Stack, Unstack, Pickup and Putdown of the blocks world domain. Express the following problem2 (with one robot hand A) in the language. a nN The Given State The Goal FIGURE 10.32 foo Download Graphplan or STAN and run the above problem. Verify that the plan is made up of 16 stages of one action each ( unstack(h, H, J) , stack(h, H, E) , pickup(h, D) , stack(h, D, B) , unstack(h, J, F) , stack(h, J, D) , unstack(h, F, 1 , stack(h, F, C) , unstack(h, H, E) , stack(h, H, 1 , pickup(h, E) , stack(h, E, J) , unstack(h, A, G) , stack(h, A, F) , pickup(h, G) , stack(h, G, E) ). Is this a unique plan? Also verify that the goals first appear nonmutex after layer 8, and that the fixed point is reached (graph lavels off) at layer 10. . In the above problem, replace the single hand h with two hands and od r. Run the program on the new problem. Run the program on the problem suggested by Blum and Furst (1995). Given (on A B , (on B C), (on-table C) Goal (on A B , (on B C), (on C A and observe the program's behaviour. . Run the program on Sussman s anomaly, Given (on C A , (on-table A), (on-table B) Goal (on A B , (on B C), (on-table C) What is the solution found? Is it found before the fixed point or after? 11. Consider the following planning problem. Domain predicates: OXY, cX, AE, hX -short form on(X, Y), clear(X), AE, holding(xX) Operators: uXY, sXY -short form (unstack (X, Y) (preconditions : on(X, Y), clear(X), AE) (effects : holding(X), clear(Y), AE, on(X, Y)) (stack (X, Y) (preconditions : holding(X), clear(Y) (effects : on(X, Y), AE, holding(X), clear(Y)) Start Sp: on(A, B), on(C, D), AE, clear(A), clear(B), clear(E) Goalg: on(4, D) Construct a planning graph of two action layers (PO, A1, P1, A2, P2) 12.
