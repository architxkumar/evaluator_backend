At IBM, Nathaniel Rochester and his colleagues produced some of the first AI pro-
grams. Herbert Gelernter (1959) constructed the Geometry Theorem Prover, which was
able to prove theorems that many students of mathematics would find quite tricky. Starting
in 1952, Arthur Samuel wrote a series of programs for checkers (draughts) that eventually
learned toplay atastrong amateurlevel. Along theway, he disproved theidea that comput-

used machines that were still on the testing floor at IBM s manufacturing plant. Chapter 5
