19.1 A LOGICAL FORMULATION OF LEARNING
Chapter 18 defined pure inductive learning as a process of finding a hypothesis that agrees
withtheobservedexamples. Here,wespecializethisdefinitiontothecasewherethehypoth-

also be logical sentences, and a new example can be classified by inferring a classification
sentence from the hypothesis and the example description. This approach allows for incre-

because sentences that are already known can assist in the classification of new examples.

and so on. In a logical setting, an example is described by a logical sentence; the attributes
become unary predicates. Let us generically call the ith example X . For instance, the first

The aim of inductive learning in general is to find a hypothesis that classifies the ex-
amples well and generalizes well to new examples. Herewe are concerned withhypotheses
