 a schemata too can correspond to several solutions. The schemata 10** could correspond to the solutions 1000, 1001, 1010 and 1011. Thus if the binary schema consists of n number of *s, it can correspond to 2 solutions. In general, in a population of N n-bit solutions, the lower bound of the number of schemata contained within it is 2". Such a case occurs when all solutions in the population are identical (degenerate). For example, if we consider N = 4 and = 2, then the following population 10, 10, 16, 10 will conform to the four (2?) schemata 10, 1*, *1 and **. The upper bound of the number of schemata will be N. 2 which is true when the solutions are all diverse as in 00, OL, 10, 11 Each of these solutions corresponds to four schemata as argued previously. However since there are bound to be repetitions, the upper bound is always less than 16 (2"N). Further the total number of possible schemata in n-bit solutions is 3". This is so as there are three possibilities a position can assume, viz. 0,1 or *. Thus, for # = 2, the total number of schemata possible is 9 and comprises 00, 01, 10, 11, O*, *0, *1, 1* and **. 23.7.2 Order of a Schemata The order of a schemata is defined as the number of fixed positions in the schemata. It is thus the difference between the length of the schemata and the number of *s it contains. For example, the order of the schemata 10**1 is given by o (10**1) =5 -2=3. 23.7.3. Defining Length of Schemata The distance between the first and last fixed positions of the schemata is termed as its defining length 6. Thus the defining length of the schemata 0*11 is given by 5(0 * 1 1) =4-1=3 T T T Tf Bit Position 1 2 3 4 Now that we know what schemata are, we proceed to finding how they change over the generations in a GA due to Reproduction, Crossover and Mutation.
