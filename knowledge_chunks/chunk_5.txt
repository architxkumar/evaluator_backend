There are two distinct strands of Al activity. One, a more cognitive approach, seeks to understand how intelligent behaviour arises. For researchers pursuing this flavour, Al provides a computational platform to test their ideas. The other strand adopts an engineering approach, and the goal is to construct intelligent machines. What the two have in common is that the ideas manifest themselves in computer programs. And these programs draw upon ideas from many disciplines computer science, philosophy, psychology, economics, mathematics, logic and operations research. The problem solving viewpoint says that intelligence is the ability to solve problems. We often refer to an autonomous program that senses its environment and acts independently in a goal directed manner as an agent. Then, given a state in which a problem solver exists, and given a set of actions that the problem solving agent has access to, the intelligent agent choses
