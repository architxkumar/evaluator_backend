Many real-world CS Psinclude preference constraints
CONSTRAINTS
indicating whichsolutions arepreferred. Forexample,ina university class-scheduling prob-
lem there are absolute constraints that no professor can teach two classes at the same time.
Butwealsomayallowpreference constraints: Prof.Rmightpreferteaching inthemorning,
whereas Prof. N prefers teaching in the afternoon. A schedule that has Prof. R teaching at
2p.m.wouldstillbeanallowablesolution(unless Prof.Rhappenstobethedepartmentchair)
butwouldnotbeanoptimalone. Preference constraints canoftenbeencoded ascostsonin-
dividual variable assignments for example, assigning an afternoon slot for Prof. R costs
2 points against the overall objective function, whereas a morning slot costs 1. With this
formulation, CS Ps with preferences can be solved with optimization search methods, either
CONSTRAINT
path-based or local. We call such a problem a constraint optimization problem, or COP.

6.2 CONSTRAINT PROPAGATION: INFERENCE IN CSPS
Inregular state-space search, analgorithm can doonly one thing: search. In CS Psthere is a
choice: analgorithmcansearch(chooseanewvariableassignmentfromseveralpossibilities)
or do a specific type of inference called constraint propagation: using the constraints to

LOCAL The key idea is local consistency. If we treat each variable as a node in a graph (see
CONSISTENCY
Figure 6.1(b)) and each binary constraint as an arc, then the process of enforcing local con-
sistency ineach part of the graph causes inconsistent values tobe eliminate
