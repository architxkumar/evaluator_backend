Skill matching (P,) 2. Budget (P,) 3. Distribution of employees (P,) 4. Preference of employees (P,) each of which are defined by the following equations: Ts Pi= DDR; - R;| * factor i=l jel P P,= ya" *: it Cy > By else P, = 0 k=l Me = DX Eni = =l L_*100 P, r N Yep P,= = *100 T where T is the total number of employees required by the projects (equal to the number of genes), S the number of skills in the skill set, R , the skill rating for skill 7 of the employee with Id as in gene i, Ri, the skill rating for skill j of the project with Id as in gene i, factor=1.5 if Rij=0 (absence of skill) =05 if RE>Re (overqualified) =1 if RES Ri (under qualified), P is the number of projects, C., is the total salary of the allocated employees to project k, B, is the budget of the project &, N is the total number of available employees, Ep; =1 if employee with Id i is allocated to more than one project =( otherwise Ep, = 1 if the employee with Id / is allocated a project of his preference = 0 otherwise. Finally, the fitness function is given by, S= (WP, + wo Py + We Pa t wy P ST The GA aims at obtaining an allocation that has maximum value for this fitness function. 465 Weights w, to w, are assigned to each of the constraints according to their importance (rated from 0-1) by the manager. In the current case we simplify the model by equating all these weights to unity. Also if the distribution penalty is greater than zero it implies that the allocation is an infeasible one and needs to be rejected. Hence the fitness of such a chromosome is divided by 100 to obtain a low value. This ensures that virtually no employee is working for more than one project. 466 Crossover Artificial In
