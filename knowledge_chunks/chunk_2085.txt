cases the query language is so simple that difficult queries cannot be posed. In cases where
the expressive powerproves to be too limiting, many semantic network systems provide for
procedural attachment to fill in the gaps. Procedural attachment is a technique whereby
a query about (or sometimes an assertion of) a certain relation results in a call to a special
procedure designed forthatrelationratherthanageneral inference algorithm.
One of the most important aspects of semantic networks is their ability to represent
