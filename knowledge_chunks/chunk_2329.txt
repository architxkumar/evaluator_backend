host now offers you achoice: either you can take the 1,000,000 prize oryou can gamble it
on the flip of a coin. If the coin comes up heads, you end up with nothing, but if it comes
up tails, you get 2,500,000. If you re like most people, you would decline the gamble and
pocketthemillion. Areyoubeingirrational?

To determine what to do, we need to assign utilities to the outcome states. Utility is not
directly proportional tomonetary value, because theutilityforyourfirstmillionisveryhigh

money was almost exactly proportional to the logarithm of the amount. (This idea was first
suggested by Bernoulli (1738); see Exer
