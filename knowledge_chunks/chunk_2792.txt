Several good textbooks on speech recognition are available (Rabiner and Juang, 1993;
Jelinek, 1997; Goldand Morgan, 2000;Huangetal.,2001). Thepresentation inthischapter

Martin(2008). Speechrecognition researchispublishedin Computer Speechand Language,
Speech Communications, and the IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Pro-
cessing and at the DARPA Workshops on Speech and Natural Language Processing and the
Eurospeech, ICSLP,and ASR Uconferences.

Ken Church (2004) shows that natural language research has cycled between concen-
trating on the data (empiricism) and concentrating on theories (rationalism). The linguist
John Firth(1957)proclaimed Youshallknowawordbythecompanyitkeeps, andlinguis-
tics of the 1940s and early 1950s was based largely on word frequencies, although without
the computational power we have available today. Then Noam (Chomsky, 1956) showed
thelimitations offinite-state models, andsparked aninterest intheoretical studies ofsyntax,
disregarding frequency counts. This approach dominated fortwenty years, until empiricism
made a comeback based on the success of work in statistical speech recognition (Jelinek,
1976). Today,mostworkacceptsthestatisticalframework, butthereisgreatinterestinbuild-
ingstatistical modelsthat consider higher-level models, such assyntactic treesand semantic
