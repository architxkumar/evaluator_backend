environments are episodic at higher levels than the agent s individual actions. For example,
a chess tournament consists of a sequence of games; each game is an episode because (by
and large) the contribution of the moves in one game to the agent s overall performance is
notaffected bythemovesinitsprevious game. Ontheotherhand, decision makingwithina
