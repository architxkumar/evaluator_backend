Finally,supposethatwearechoosingbetweenthetwodirtroadsinsummertime,when
blockage byavalanches isunlikely. Inthis case, satellite reports might show one route tobe
more scenic than the other because of flowering alpine meadows, orperhaps wetterbecause
of errant streams. It is therefore quite likely that we would change our plan if we had the
information. In this case, however, the difference in value between the two routes is still

In sum, information has value to the extent that it is likely to cause a change of plan

16.6.3 Properties ofthe valueofinformation
One might ask whether it is possible for information to be deleterious: can it actually have
negative expected value? Intuitively, one should expect this to be impossible. After all, one
