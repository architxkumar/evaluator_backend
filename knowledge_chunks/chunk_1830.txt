operates and deduce what actions totake. Weused propositional logic as ourrepresentation
language because it sufficed to illustrate the basic concepts of logic and knowledge-based
agents. Unfortunately, propositional logic is too puny a language to represent knowledge
of complex environments in a concise way. In this chapter, we examine first-order logic,1

which is sufficiently expressive to represent a good deal of our commonsense knowledge.
