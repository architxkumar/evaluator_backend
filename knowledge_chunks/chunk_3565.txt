Sec. 14.3 Intermediate-Level Image Processing 303 Region Segmentation through Splitting and Merging Rather than defining regions with edges, it is possible to build them. For example, global structures can be constructed from groups of pixels by locating, connecting, and defining regions having homogeneous features such as color, texture, or intensity. The resulting segmented regions are expected to correspond to surfaces of objects in the real world. Such coherent regions do not always correspond to meaningful regions, but they do offer another viable approach to the segmentation of an image. When these methods are combined with other segmentation techniques, the confidence level that the regions represent meaningful objects will be high. Once an image has been segmented into disjointed object areas, the areas can be labeled with their properties and their relationships to other objects, and then identified through model matching or description satisfaction. Region segmentation may be accomplished by region splitting, by region growing (also-called region merging), or by a combination of the two. When splitting is
