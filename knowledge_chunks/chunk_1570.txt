Bibliographical and Historical Notes 109 A search expands nodes withminimal f(n) g(n) h(n). A iscomplete and
optimal, provided that h(n) is admissible (for TREE-SEARCH) or consistent (for GRAPH-SEARCH). Thespacecomplexityof A isstillprohibitive. RBFS (recursive best-first search) and SMA (simplified memory-bounded A )
are robust, optimal search algorithms that use limited amounts of memory; given enough time, they can solve problems that A cannot solve because it runs out of
memory. Theperformance ofheuristic search algorithms depends on the quality ofthe heuristic
function. One can sometimes construct good heuristics by relaxing the problem defi-
nition, bystoring precomputed solution costs forsubproblems inapattern database, or
bylearning fromexperience withtheproblemclass.
