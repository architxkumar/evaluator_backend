ils. The sequence below shows how N changes its values. p(i) > q(1) False < Backtrack to p p(2) > q2) ! 1(2) False Cannot backtrack; thus fails. What would happen if there is an alternative path for do as in - do:- p(N),q(N),nl,write(N),!,1(N). do. 506 Artificial Intelligence TSA AT The effect would remain the same, thanks to the cut that makes the inference engine forget about the fork at do in toto! Now try adding the fact r(2) and see the effect. Here is a simple program that helps select a car described by its brand name, color and cost. car(palio, black, 450000). car(hyundai, silver, 300000). car(fiat, silver, 400000). car(maruti, black, 20000). get_car(Colos,Cost_Less_Than):- car(Name, Color,Cost),!,Cost<Cost_Less_Than, nl, write(Name). The goal get_car(black,3 50000). does not yield a solution in spite of the fact that one of the cars viz. the maruti satisfies the same. This is so because after the variables - Name and Cost are bound to palio and 450000, the cut is crossed and the condition 350000 < 450000 is checked. Since the condition is not satisfied a backtracking is initiated but prevented due to the cut, yielding no solutions. Now re-order the facts for car with car(maruti, black, 20000) as the very first one and try the same goal. 25.11 RECURSION A tecursive procedure is one that calls itself. A simple recursive procedure often used for implementing loops, is given below repeat. rep at:- repeat. Such a program becomes handy when we have only one solution and we need to introduce backtracking. The repeat structure makes PROLOG s inference engine to believe that there are infinite number of solutions. Inspect the next program which will make things clearer. getinput:- redo, grab(Ch),string_chars(C,{Ch]), write(C),Ch= =13. redo. redo:- redo. The grab/] predicate takes in a single character in ASCII directly from the keyboard while the string _chars/2 predicate converts the input into a regular string which is displayed by write. The second argument of th
