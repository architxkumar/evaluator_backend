 types of stars
revealed by the spectra, and, if so, how many types and what are their characteristics? We
are all familiar with terms such as red giant and white dwarf, but the stars do not carry
these labels on their hats astronomers had to perform unsupervised clustering to identify
these categories. Other examples include the identification of species, genera, orders, and
so on in the Linn an taxonomy and the creation of natural kinds for ordinary objects (see
Chapter12).
Unsupervised clustering beginswithdata. Figure20.11(b) shows500datapoints,each
ofwhichspecifies thevalues oftwocontinuous attributes. Thedatapoints mightcorrespond
to stars, and the attributes might correspond to spectral intensities at two particular frequen-
cies. Next,weneedtounderstandwhatkindofprobability distribution mighthavegenerated

DISTRIBUTION
Such a distribution has k components, each of which is a distribution in its own right. A
