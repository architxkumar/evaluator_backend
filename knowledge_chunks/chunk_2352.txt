negative expected value? Intuitively, one should expect this to be impossible. After all, one

Itisimportanttorememberthat VP Idependsonthecurrentstateofinformation, which
is why it is subscripted. It can change as more information is acquired. Forany given piece
of evidence E , the value of acquiring it can go down (e.g., if another variable strongly

constrains the posterior for E ) or up (e.g., if another variable provides a clue on which E

Order independence distinguishes sensing actions from ordinary actions and simplifies the

16.6.4 Implementationofaninformation-gathering agent
A sensible agent should ask questions in a reasonable order, should avoid asking questions
that are irrelevant, should take into account the importance of each piece of information in
relation to its cost, and should stop asking questions when that is appropriate. All of these
capabilities canbeachievedbyusingth
