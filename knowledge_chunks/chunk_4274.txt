 the basis for many understanding programs. PAM [Wilensky, 1981] is an early example; it translated stories into a CD representation. Another such program was BORIS {Dyer, 1983]. BORIS used a memory structure called the Thematic Abstraction Unit to organize knowledge about plans, goals, interpersonal relationships, and emotions. For other examples, see Allen and Perrault [1980] and Sidner[1985]. 15.4.4 Speech Acts Language is a form of behavior. We use it as one way to accomplish our goals. In essence, we make communicative plans in much the same sense that we make plans for anything else [Austin, 1962]. In fact, as we just saw in the example above, John could have achieved his goal of locating a screwdriver by asking someone where it was rather than by looking for it. The elements of communicative plans are called speech acts {Searte, 1969]. We can axiomatize speech acts just as we axiomatized other operators in the previous section, except that we need to make use of modal operators that describe states of belief, knowledge, wanting, etc, For example, we can define the basic speech act A INFORM B of P as follows: TINFORM(A, B, P) precondition: BELIEVE(A, P) KNOW-WHAT(A, LOCATION(B)) postcondition: BELIEVE(B, BELIEVE(A, P)) BELIEVE-IN(B, A) BELIEVER, (B, P) To execute this operation, A must believe P and A must know where B is. The result of this operator is that B believes that A believes P. and if B believes in the truth of what A says, then B also believes P. We can define other speech acts similarly. For example, we can define ASK-WHAT (in which A asks B the value of some predicate P): ASK-WHATI(A, B, P): precondition: KNOW-WHAT(A, LOCATION(B)) KNOW-WHAT(B, P) WILLING-TO-PERFORM (B, INFORM(8, A, P)) postcondition: KNOW-WHAT(A, P) This is the action that John could have performed as an alternative way of finding a screwdriver. We can also define other speech acts, such as A REQUEST B to perform R: REQUEST(A, B, R} precondition: KNOW-WHAT(A, LOCATION(B)) CAN-PERF
