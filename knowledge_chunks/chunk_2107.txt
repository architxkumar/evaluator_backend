Interest in larger-scale ontologies is increasing, as documented by the Handbook on
Ontologies (Staab, 2004). The OPENCYC project (Lenat and Guha, 1990; Matuszek et al.,
2006) hasreleased a150,000-concept ontology, withanupperontology similartotheonein

of cellular phone, which in turn is a type of consumer electronics, phone, wireless
communication device, and other concepts. The DBPEDIA project extracts structured data
from Wikipedia; specifically from Infoboxes: the boxes of attribute value pairs that accom-
pany many Wikipedia articles (Wu and Weld, 2008; Bizer et al., 2007). As of mid-2009,
DBPEDIA contains 2.6million concepts, withabout 100 facts perconcept. The IEE Ework-
inggroup P1600.1createdthe Suggested Upper Merged Ontology(SUMO)(Nilesand Pease,
2001; Pease and Niles, 2002), which contains about 1000 terms in the upper ontology and
links to over 20,000 domain-specific terms. Stoffel et al. (1997) describe algorithms for ef-
ficiently managing a very large ontology. A survey of techniques for extracting knowledge
from Webpagesisgivenby Etzioni etal.(2008).
On the Web, representation languages are emerging. RDF (Brickley and Guha, 2004)
allows for assertions to be made in the form of relational triples, and provides some means
