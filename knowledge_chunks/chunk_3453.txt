Write a LISP function called "match" that takes two arguments and returns T if the two are identical, returns the two arguments if one is a variable and the other a term and returns nil, otherwise. 10.4. Identify the following variables as nominal, ordinal, binary or interval: temperature sex wavelength university class population intelligence quality of restaurant 10,5. What is the difference between a bag and a set? Give examples of both. Hov. could a program determine whether a data structure was either a bag or a set? 10.6.

Give three dierent examples of functionsf that can be used in the similarity equations 10.3 and 10.4. 10.8. Choose two simple objects 01 and 02 that are somewhat similar in their features Al and A2, respectively, and compute the similarity of the two using a form ol equation 10.4. 10.9. Define two fuzzy sets ''tall" and "short'' and compute the distance between theill using equation 10.5. 10.10. For the two sets defined in Problem 10.9. compute the similarity of the two using equation 10.6. 10.11. Write a LISP function to find the intersection of two sets using the marking method described in the subsection entitled Matching Sets and Bags. 10,12.
