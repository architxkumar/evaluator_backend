The objects in the model may be related in various ways. In the figure, Richard and
John are brothers. Formally speaking, a relation is just the set of tuples of objects that are
TUPLE
related. (Atuple isacollection ofobjects arranged inafixedorderandiswrittenwithangle
brackets surrounding theobjects.) Thus,thebrotherhood relationinthismodelistheset (cid:16)Richard the Lionheart, King John(cid:17), (cid:16)King John, Richardthe Lionheart(cid:17) . (8.1)

just one tuple, (cid:16)thecrown, King John(cid:17). The brother and on head relations are binary
relations that is, they relate pairs of objects. The model also contains unary relations, or
properties: the person propertyistrueofboth Richardand John;the king propertyistrue
onlyof John(presumably because Richardisdeadatthispoint);andthe crown propertyis
trueonlyofthecrown.
Certain kinds of relationships are best considered as functions, in that a given object
must berelated to exactly one object in this way. Forexample, each person has one left leg,

Strictly speaking, models in first-order logic require total functions, that is, there must be a
