 shown below in Figure 5.5, there are two long edges that must be part of any tour, but neither will figure in the lower bound estimate. The two edges occur in all tours. Yet they do not figure in the lower bound. FIGURE 5.5 The lower bound estimated costs may not be feasible in practice. Consider now the refinement search space. The root consists of a node representing all solutions. We can partition this set in two, one subset including a particular arc, and the other excluding it. These two sets can then be further refined recursively till each node describes one tour precisely. Part of the search tree is depicted below in Figure 5.6. It contains all the twelve distinct tours in the leaves. Some leaves that have not been fully refined contain more than one tour. A label like CB says the segment CB is included in the tour(s) in that node, while CB says that it is not present in the tour(s) in that node. In addition, the tours in a node must also be consistent with the labels at the ancestor nodes. The next task is to estimate the cost of these partially refined solutions. Wherever an arc is known to be part of a tour, we add the known cost. Otherwise we choose the smallest possible segments. For example, the estimated cost of a tour including the Chennai-Mumbai (CM) segment is (360 1280) (570 590) (590 1280) (1540 2080) (360 570) 2 LB 010 a 4505 In the above case, the CM cost (1280) was included for both the Chennai and the Mumbai segments. The lower bound cost then went up to 4505. Suppose in addition to the above, we also want to include the Mumbai Bangalore (MB) segment. The cost of this segment, 1210, will have to be included as well. (360 1280) (570 590) (1210 1280) (1540 2080) (360 1210) LB 2 It has located longer tours earlier in the search, but coal of other tours exceed a ignored them. Ea) fully refined tour.
