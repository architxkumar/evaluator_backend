have resolved the issue of what could be the flow rates, the actual crisp value still eludes us. Defuzzifier This is where we have to demystify these fuzzy terms for the flow rate controller system. In other words, the fuzzy outputs LOW-POSITIVE, POSITIVE and HIGH-POSITIVE are to be converted to a single crisp value which can then be delivered to the final actuator of the pump. This process is called defuzzification. Several methods are used to achieve defuzzification, the most common ones being the Centre of Gravity method and the Composite Maxima method. In both these methods we need to compute the composite region formed by the portions A, B, C and D (See Fig. 22.4) on the output profile. Figure 22.4 shows how this is calculated. In case of parameters whose premises are connected by an AND, the minimum of their memberships is first found.
