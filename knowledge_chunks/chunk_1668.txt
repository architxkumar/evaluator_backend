Using this technique and a tour de force of optimization tricks, Ken Thompson (1986,
1996) and Lewis Stiller (1992, 1996) solved all chess endgames with up to five pieces and
some with six pieces, making them available on the Internet. Stiller discovered one case

the rules of chess require a capture or pawn move to occur within 50 moves. Laterwork by

If we could extend the chess endgame tables from 6 pieces to 32, then White would
know onthe opening movewhether itwould be awin, loss, ordraw. This has not happened
