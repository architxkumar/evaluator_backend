or other cities and other seasons, then one could compute P(Fruit Litchi) by using the sum rule and marginalising the other variables. Let us look at a small contrived example. In the following example, the probabilities are all with respect to your friend Sumedha being in one of the cities or eating the fruit. Let us assume that Sumedha can be found in one of three cities, Bengaluru with probability 0.6, Dehradun with probability 0.2 and Madurai with probability 0.2. Also let us say that the conditional probabilities for finding (and eating) litchis in the cities are as follows, P(Litchi Bengaluru) 0.4 P(Litchi Madurai) 0.4 P(Litchi Dehradun) 0.9 You see Sumedha s status message and find that it says Enjoying litchis . Where do you think that she is likely to be? Let us first apply the sum rule to compute P(Litchi), which stands for the probability that Sumedha is eating litchis. P(Litchi) P(Litchi Bengaluru) P(Bengaluru) P(Litchi Madurai) P(Madurai) P(Litchi Dehradun) P(Madurai) 0.4 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.9 0.2 0.5 The overall probability of her eating litchis is 0.5. Now knowing that Sumedha is in fact eating litchis, we can apply the Bayes rule to compute the following conditional probabilities. P(Bengaluru Litchi) P(Litchi Bengaluru) P(Bengaluru) P(Litchi) 0.4 0.6 P(Litchi) 0.24 P(Litchi) 0.24 0.5 0.48 P(Madurai Litchi) P(Litchi Madurai) P(Madurai) P(Litchi) 0.4 0.2 P(Litchi) 0.08 P(Litchi) 0.08 0.5 0.16 P(Dehradun Litchi) P(Litchi Dehradun) P(Dehradun) P(Litchi) 0.9 0.2 P(Litchi) 0.18 P(Litchi) 0.18 0.5 0.36 The three conditional probabilities P(Litchi Bengaluru), P(Litchi Madurai), (Litchi Dehradun) are the likelihoods of the variable Fruit Litchi, given the three values of random variable City. The expressions on left hand side of the posterior probabilities of each city, given the evidence that litchis are available. They are 0.48, 0.16 and 0.36 for Bengaluru, Madurai and Dehradun respectively. These are also called the a posteriori probabilities, as compared the a
