 and Stergiou, 2001)). One way to do this is by introducing extra variables. Consider a variation of the above CSP containing a relation over all three variables.

A similar definition can be given for the other two relations Roz and R3z. One can also express these relations using the projection operator of relational algebra in which the projections of the tuples in Z match the corresponding variable. The conversion to the binary CSP is done by adding extra variables. This is often needed because it has been shown that the number of binary CSPs that can be constructed with N variables is much smaller than the number of relations of N variables (Montanari, 1974). In any case, a vast array of problems can be expressed as finite binary CSPs. Given the uniform manner in which all these problems are formulated, one can explore and exploit efficient techniques for solving them. 9.1 N-Queens Consider the problem of placing N queens on an N x N chessboard, so that no queen attacks another. As a state space search problem, we would have modelled it as a problem of placing queens on an empty chessboard. The initial state of the problem is illustrated for N 6 in Figure 9.2. www www hw Ww tn 6 FIGURE 9.2 The six queen problem is to place the six queens on a 6 x 6 ch
