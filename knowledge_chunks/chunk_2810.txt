These arise because of the presence of noise in the image. If wesmooth the image first, the
spurious peaksarediminished, asweseeinthebottomofthefigure.

The measurement of brightness at a pixel in a CCD camera is based on a physical
process involving the absorption of photons and the release of electrons; inevitably there
will be statistical fluctuations of the measurement noise. The noise can be modeled with
