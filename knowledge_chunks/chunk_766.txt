cle riding event has a duration, and during that duration fluent ridingBike(Person) is true. Then we can express the distance the person has travelled at any given time by a function of the speed. Let us say that Nikhil rides his bike at S metres second. Then we can write the following expression, (HoldsAt(loc(nikhil53, home86), t3) A Happens(ride(nikhil53, bicycle39, home86, restaurant66), t3) A (3 T) A AClipped(t;, ridingBike(nikhil53), T)) HoldsAtdist(nikhil53, home86, S T), t; T) The above expression says that if Nikhil was at location Home at time fs, and started riding his bike (at a constant speed of S meters sec) then at time t3 T he will be S T meters away from home, provided the ridingBike fluent was not terminated in the intervening period. The trajectory axiom allows us to say that in a succinct form as follows: HoldsAt(loc(nikhil53, home86), t3) Trajectorv(ridingBike(nikhil53), t;, dist(nikhil53, home86, S T), T) which may be generalized as, HoldsAt(loc(P, L), to) D Trajectory(ridingBike(P), to dist(P, L, S T), T) which says that if a person P is at a location L, and some event happens that initiates the ridingBike(P) fluent at time fp, then the distance of the person from L after time Tis given by S T. This brief introduction to the event calculus has given us a glimpse of an approach for logical reasoning in a changing world, and the issues involved. Like FOL, the event calculus gives us a mechanism for making deductions about what becomes or remains true as a result of events happening. The changing properties are represented as fluents that are initiated or terminated by events. 13.5.5 Knowledge and Belief How do we model the knowledge held by agents? If one is to model an agent having knowledge of some relations ( Sydney knows that Charles loves Lucie ) or some events ( Akira knows that the flight had taken off ) or even beliefs ( Drona believed that Aswathama had been killed ), then one has to add the corresponding formulas as reified objects that
