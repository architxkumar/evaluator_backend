The following definition assumes that the concepts human and wizard have been defined already. It says that muggles are those humans that are not wizards. owl:Class rdf:ID muggle owl:intersectionO rdf:parseType Collection owl:Class rdf:about human owl:Restriction owl:complementOf rdf:resource wizard owl:Restriction owl:intersectionOf owl:Class New concepts may also be defined by constraints on the property fillers. The following definition of a data type property called year says that year is a value of type nonNegativelnteger, defined in the XML namespace. owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:ID year rdfs:range rdf:resource http: www.w3.org 2001 XLMSchema nonNegativeInteger owl:DatatypeProperty Object properties on the other hand relate objects of a particular class to objects of another class. The following example relates a music composition to the composer. It also says that the composedBy property is a subproperty of musician, is the inverse of property composition (that would relate a composer to a composition), and is also known by the name musicScoreBy. Observe that OWL allows one to organize properties into a hierarchy, and allows one property to be declared as the inverse of another, or equivalent to another. owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID composedBy owl:domain rdf:resource musicNumber owl:range rdf:resource composer rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource musician owl:inverseOf rdf:resource composition owl:equivalentProperty rdf:resource musicScoreBy owl:ObjectProperty The following constraints on properties, specified by owl:Restriction, are equivalent to ALL r d , FILLS r c , an
