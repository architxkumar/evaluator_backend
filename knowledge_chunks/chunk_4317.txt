The Rest of a HEARSAY-II Blackboard But these new blackboard systems also provide facilities that HEARSAY-II lacked. In HEARSAY-II, control was data-driven. This worked well for speech understanding. But for other kinds of problem solving, other kinds of contro! are more appropriate. Examples include control that is driven either by goals or by 344 Artificial Intelligence plans. The newer blackboard systems provide explicit support for these other control mechanisms. One important way in which they do that is to allow the use of multiple blackboards. Although this idea can also be exploited as a way to modularize domain reasoning, one of its important uses is to exploit one blackboard for reasoning in the problem domain and another for controlling that reasoning. In addition, these systems provide a goal-structured agenda mechanism that can be used in the control space to allow problem solving to be driven by an explicit goal structure. See Englemore and Morgan [1989] and Jagannathan et al. [1989] for further descriptions of these systems and some applications that have been built on top of them. Message-Passing Systems Message-passing systems provide an alternative way for agents in a distributed reasoning system to communicate with each other. In such a framewo
