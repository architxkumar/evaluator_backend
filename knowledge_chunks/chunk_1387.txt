Overview of the book
The main unifying theme is the idea of an intelligent agent. We define AI as the study of
agents thatreceive percepts from theenvironment andperform actions. Eachsuchagent im-
plements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to
represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic
systems. Weexplaintheroleoflearningasextendingthereachofthedesignerintounknown
environments, and we show how that role constrains agent design, favoring explicit knowl-
edgerepresentation andreasoning. Wetreatroboticsandvisionnotasindependently defined
