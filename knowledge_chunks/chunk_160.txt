ged in the order of P, giving the two offspring C, (1, 5, 9, 8, 4, 7, 2, 6, 3) and Cz (2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 3) In Cycle Crossover (CX), the attempt is made to inherit the position of each city in the offspring from one of the two parents as far as possible. We start constructing the two offspring with the first city as C1 (2, xX, X, X, X, X, X, X, X), and Co (4, x, X, X, X, X X, X, X) Since CX tries to inherit the position of each city from one of the parents, it can be seen that in C,the position of city 4 can only be inherited from P,, because the first slot where 4 occurs in Pais already used up in C,. Likewise, the position of city 2 in Cacan only be inherited from Po, giving C, (2, 4, x, x, X, X, X, X, X), and C2 (4, X, X, 2, X, X, X, X X) Now since 4 is in second place in Cy, the position of the other city in the second place, that is city 5, can only be inherited from one parent, which is C,. In this manner, we propagate the constraints till we cannot fill up a city without creating a cycle in the partial tour. At this stage, we have Cy (2, 4, x, 1, 5, 9, 8, 3.6), and C2 (4, 5, x, 2, 6, 8, 1, 9, 3) The remaining cities, in this case there is only one, is filled up from the other parent. Let us look at another example where a smaller subtour is selected. Given two parents P3 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and P, (3,4,6,5,2,7,9,8, 1) the reader should verify that the subtours chosen by from one parent are C3 (1, x, 3, x, x, 6, 7, x, 9) from P, and C4 (3, x, 6, x, x, 7, 9, x, 1) from Pg In the positions marked x, the cities from the two parents are exchanged, giving C3 (1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9), and C4 (3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 7, 9, 8, 1) We can see the cycle crossover as a carefully chosen simple multipoint crossover, in which selected parts of the two chromosomes are exchanged. Ordinal Representation Interestingly, there does exist a tour representation where the simple crossover can be used producing valid tours. This is known as the ordinal representation. We begi
