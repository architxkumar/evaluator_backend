PDD Lisalanguagethatcarefullybalancestheexpressiveness ofthelanguagewiththecom-
plexity ofthealgorithms thatoperate onit. Butsomeproblemsremaindifficulttoexpress in
PDDL. Forexample, we can t express the goal move all the cargo from A to B regardless
ofhowmanypiecesofcargothereare in PDDL,butwecandoitinfirst-orderlogic,usinga
universal quantifier. Likewise, first-orderlogiccanconcisely express global constraints such
as nomorethanfourrobotscanbeinthesameplaceatthesame time. PDD Lcanonlysay
thiswithrepetitious preconditions oneverypossible actionthatinvolves amove.
The propositional logic representation of planning problems also has limitations, such
as the fact that the notion of time is tied directly to fluents. For example, South2 means the
