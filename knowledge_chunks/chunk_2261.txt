Inaddition totheseinference tasks,wealsohave Learning: The transition and sensor models, if not yet known, can be learned from
observations. Justaswithstatic Bayesiannetworks,dynamic Bayesnetlearningcanbe
done as a by-product of inference. Inference provides an estimate of what transitions
actually occurred andofwhatstatesgenerated thesensorreadings, andthese estimates
canbeused toupdate themodels. Theupdated models provide newestimates, and the
process iterates to convergence
