 sensitization), book and books (singular and plural) as distinct ones. Thus we arrive at two terms called Types and Tokens. The former means the number of distinct words in the corpus while the latter stands for the total number of words in the corpus. In the last sentence, (the one earlier to this), for example, we have 14 types and 24 tokens. 15.5.3 N-Grams N-grams are basically sequences of N words or strings, where N could assume the value 1,2,3, and so on. When N=1, we call it a unigram (just one word). N=2 makes a bigram (a sequence of two words), Similarly we have trigrams, tetragrams and so on. Let s see in what way these N-grams make sense to us. Different words in a corpus have their own frequency (i.e. the number of times they occur) in a given corpus. Some words have a high frequency like the article the . As an example let us take the number of occurrences of words in the novel - The Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orczy (It also provides for good reading! You can download the text from http://www.gutenberg.org). The novel has around 87163 words and 8822 types or word forms. Some typical words within are listed in the Table 15.1 along with their probabilities of occurrence in the text.

Let us go a step further and ask - What is the probability of a word being followed by another? Natural Language Processing 323 Given the word however, and the words the and ir that could follow we can use the respective probabilities (of the and if) to guess that the word the is a better candidate. Note that the has higher probability. But things do not alw
