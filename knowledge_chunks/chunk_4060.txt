of the combination formula. If no nonempty subsets are created, the scaling factor is 1, so we were able to ignore it in our first example. But to see how it works, let s add a new piece of evidence to our example. As a result of applying m, and m,, we produced my. {Flu, Cold} (0.48) (All, Flu,Cold) (0.32) | Flu,Cold,Pneu} (0.12) 9 (0.08) Now, let m, correspond to our belief given just the evidence that the problem goes away when the patient goes on a trip: ~ {All} (0.9) o (0.1) 184 Artificial Intelligence We can apply the numerator of the combination rule to produce (where * denotes the empty set): {A} (0.9) @ (0.1) {F.C} (0.48) (0.432) {EC} (0.048) {AFC} (0.32) {ARC} (0.288) {A, EC} (0.032) {ECP} (0.12) 6 (0.108) (FC, P} (0.012) rc) (0.08) {A} (0.072) (0.008) But there is now a total belief of 0.54 associated with ; only 0.45 is associated with outcomes that are in fact possible. So we need to scale the remaining values by the factor 1 0.54 = 0.46. If we do this, and also combine alternative ways of generating the set {All, Flu, Cold}, then we get the final combined belief function, ms. { Flu, Cold} (0.104) {All, Flu, Cold} (0.696) { Flu, Cold, Pneu} (0.026) {Al} (0.157) (o) (0:017) wee nee e eet e ene, 1 tall very tali = 0 - height height (a) Fuzzy Membership (b) Conventional Membership Fig. 8.4. Fuzzy versus Conventional Set Membership In this example, the percentage of m, that was initially assigned to the empty set was large (over half). This happens whenever there is conflicting evidence (as in this case between m, and my). 8.5 FUZZY LOGIC In the techniques we have discussed so far, we have hot modified the mathematical underpinnings provided by set theory and logic. We have instead augmented those ideas with additional constructs provided by probability theory. In this section, we take a different approach and briefly consider what happens if we make fundamental changes to our idea of set membership and corresponding changes to our definitions of logical ope
