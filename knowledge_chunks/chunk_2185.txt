s called a hybrid Bayesian
HYBRIDBAYESIAN network. To specify a hybrid network, we have to specify two new kinds of distributions:
NETWORK
the conditional distribution for a continuous variable given discrete or continuous parents;
andtheconditionaldistributionforadiscretevariablegivencontinuousparents. Considerthe
simple example in Figure 14.5, in which a customer buys some fruit depending on its cost,
whichdependsinturnonthesizeoftheharvestandwhetherthegovernment ssubsidyscheme
is operating. The variable Cost is continuous and has continuous and discrete parents; the
variable Buys isdiscreteandhasacontinuous parent.
For the Cost variable, we need to specify P(Cost Harvest,Subsidy). The discrete
parent is handled by enumeration that is, by specifying both P(Cost Harvest,subsidy)
and P(Cost Harvest, subsidy). Tohandle Harvest,wespecify howthedistribution over
the cost c depends on the continuous value h of Harvest. In other words, we specify the
parametersofthecostdistribution asafunctionofh. Themostcommonchoiceisthelinear
Gaussian distribution, in which the child has a Gaussian distribution whose mean varies

linearly with the value of the parent and whose standard deviation is fixed. We need two
distributions, oneforsubsidy andonefor subsidy,withdifferentparameters: 1 1 c (ath bt) 2
