15.4.3 The general case
The preceding derivation illustrates the key property of Gaussian distributions that allows
Kalmanfiltering towork: thefact that the exponent isaquadratic form. Thisistrue not just
fortheunivariatecase;thefullmultivariate Gaussiandistribution hastheform N( , )(x) e 2 1 (x )(cid:4) 1 (x ) .

Multiplying outthetermsintheexponent makesitclearthat theexponent isalsoaquadratic
function of the values x in x. As in the univariate case, the filtering update preserves the
i
Gaussiannatureofthestatedistribution.
Letusfirstdefinethegeneraltemporalmodelusedwith Kalmanfiltering. Boththetran-
sition model and the sensor model allow for a linear transformation with additive Gaussian
noise. Thus,wehave
P(x x ) N(Fx , )(x )
t 1 t t x t 1
(15.21)
P(z x ) N(Hx , )(z ),
t t t z t
where F and are matrices describing the linear transition model and transition noise co-

where K (F F (cid:12) )H (cid:12) (H(F F (cid:12) )H (cid:12) ) 1 iscalledthe Kalmangain

the update for the mean state estimate . The term F is the predicted state at t 1, so
t
HF is the predicted observation. Therefore, the term z HF represents the errorin

the predicted observation. This is multiplied by K to correct the predicted state; hence,
t 1
K isameasureofhowseriously totakethenewobservation relativetotheprediction. As

in Equation (15.20), wealsohavetheproperty thatthevariance update isindependent ofthe
observations. The sequence of values for and K can therefore be computed offline, and
