representation language and the way the planner interacts with the environment. This
chapter shows how. Section 11.1 extends the classical language for planning to talk about
actions with durations and resource constraints. Section 11.2 describes methods for con-
structing plans thatareorganized hierarchically. Thisallowshuman experts tocommunicate

11.1 TIME, SCHEDULES, AND RESOURCES
Theclassicalplanningrepresentationtalksaboutwhattodo,andinwhatorder,buttherepre-

be on another at the same time. This section covers methods for representing and solving
planning problemsthatincludetemporalandresource constraints.
The approach we take in this section is plan first, schedule later : that is, we divide
the overall problem into a planning phase in which actions are selected, with some ordering
constraints, to meet the goals of the problem, and a later scheduling phase, in which tempo-
ralinformation isaddedtotheplantoensure thatitmeetsresource anddeadline constraints.
