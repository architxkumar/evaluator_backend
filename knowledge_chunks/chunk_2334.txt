A: 80 chanceof 4000 C : 20 chanceof 4000
B : 100 chanceof 3000 D : 25 chanceof 3000
Most people consistently prefer B over A (taking the sure thing), and C over D (taking the
higher EMV). The normative analysis disagrees! We can see this most easily if we use the
freedom implied by Equation (16.2) to set U( 0) 0. In that case, then B A implies
that U( 3000) 0.8U( 4000), whereas C D implies exactly the reverse. In other
words, there is no utility function that is consistent with these choices. One explanation for
the apparently irrational preferences is the certainty effect (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979):

be so. First, people may prefer to reduce their computational burden; by choosing certain
outcomes, they don t have to compute with probabilities. But the effect persists even when
thecomputations involved areveryeasyones. Second, peoplemaydistrust thelegitimacyof

perhaps people who choose B over A and C over D are not being irrational; they are just
