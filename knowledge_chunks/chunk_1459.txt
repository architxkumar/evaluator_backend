INTELLIGENT AGENTS
In which we discuss the nature of agents, perfect or otherwise, the diversity of
environments, andtheresulting menagerieofagenttypes.
Chapter 1 identified the concept of rational agents as central to our approach to artificial
intelligence. Inthischapter,wemakethisnotionmoreconcrete. Wewillseethattheconcept

forbuilding successful agents systems thatcanreasonably becalled intelligent.
We begin by examining agents, environments, and the coupling between them. The
