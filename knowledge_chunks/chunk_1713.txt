raint relates two variables. For example, SA (cid:7) NSW is a binary
BINARYCONSTRAINT
constraint. A binary CSP is one with only binary constraints; it can be represented as a
constraint graph, asin Figure6.1(b).
We can also describe higher-order constraints, such as asserting that the value of Y is
between X and Z,withtheternaryconstraint Between(X,Y,Z).
GLOBAL A constraint involving an arbitrary number of variables is called a global constraint.
CONSTRAINT
(Thenameistraditional butconfusing becauseitneednotinvolveallthevariablesinaprob-
lem). One of the most common global constraints is Alldiff, which says that all of the
variables involved in the constraint must have different values. In Sudoku problems (see
Section 6.2.6), all variables in a row or column must satisfy an Alldiff constraint. An-
other example isprovided by cryptarithmetic puzzles. (See Figure 6.2(a).) Each letter in a
CRYPTARITHMETIC
cryptarithmetic puzzle represents a different digit. For the case in Figure 6.2(a), this would
be represented as the global constraint Alldiff(F,T,U,W,R,O). The addition constraints
