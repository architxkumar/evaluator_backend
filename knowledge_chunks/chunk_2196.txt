Thereisacloseconnection betweenthecomplexityof Bayesiannetworkinferenceand
the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems (CS Ps). As we discussed in Chapter 6,
the difficulty of solving a discrete CSP is related to how treelike its constraint graph is.
Measures such as tree width, which bound the complexity of solving a CSP, can also be
applied directly to Bayesian networks. Moreover, the variable elimination algorithm can be
generalized tosolve CS Psaswellas Bayesiannetworks.
