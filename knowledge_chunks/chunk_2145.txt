The two values sum to 1.0, as they should. Notice that in these two calculations the term
1 P(toothache) remains constant, no matter which value of Cavity we calculate. In fact,
it can be viewed as a normalization constant for the distribution P(Cavity toothache),

In other words, we can calculate P(Cavity toothache) even if we don t know the value of
P(toothache)! Wetemporarilyforgetaboutthefactor1 P(toothache)andaddupthevalues

they don t sum to 1, so we normalize them by dividing each one by 0.12 0.08, getting

From the example, we can extract a general inference procedure. We begin with the
case in whichthe query involves asingle variable, X (Cavity in theexample). Let Ebe the

forthem, and let Ybe theremaining unobserved variables (just Catch intheexample). The

where the summation is over all possible ys (i.e., all possible combinations of values of the
unobserved variables Y). Notice that together the variables X, E, and Yconstitute the com-
