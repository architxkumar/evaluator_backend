ked with the STRIPS planner to control the robot Shakey. The NASL planner
(Mc Dermott, 1978a) treated a planning problem simply as a specification for carrying out a
complex action, so that execution and planning were completely unified. SIPE (System for
Interactive Planning and Execution monitoring) (Wilkins, 1988, 1990) was the first planner
to deal systematically with the problem of replanning. It has been used in demonstration
projects in several domains, including planning operations on the flight deck of an aircraft
carrier, job-shop scheduling foran Australian beerfactory, and planning the construction of
multistory buildings (Kartamand Levitt,1990).
In the mid-1980s, pessimism about the slow run times of planning systems led to the
proposal of reflex agents called reactive planning systems (Brooks, 1986; Agre and Chap-

by using Boolean circuits combined with a visual representation of current goals and the

Multiagent planning has leaped in popularity in recent years, although it does have
a long history. Konolige (1982) formalizes multiagent planning in first-order logic, while
Pednault (1986) givesa STRIPS-style description. Thenotion ofjoint intention, whichis es-

partial-order planning to a multiactor setting. Brafman and Domshlak (2008) devise a mul-
