In the following chapter, we will also explore stochastic search algorithms that have explorative tendencies built into the movegeneration process itself. Before doing that, we take a small detour into a knowledge based approach to navigating a difficult heuristic terrain. 3.9 Peak to Peak Methods The problem solving algorithms seen so far operate at the operator level. Human beings, the best known problem solvers so far, rarely do so. Instead, we often break the problem into sub-problems and solve them. We also remember our problem solving experiences and learn from them. We will look at both these approaches in more detail in later chapters. Here, we look at the idea of macro operators to solve problems in a given domain. One of the first uses of macro operators was in the Means Ends Analysis (MEA) problem solving strategy proposed by Herbert Simon and Alan Newell in their pioneering study on human problemsolving (Newell and Simon, 1972). The MEA strategy operates in a top down manner. Consider the problem of transporting yourself from IIT Madras to the IIT Bombay guesthouse. The MEA strategy attempts to identify the largest difference between the current state and the desired state, and looks for a suitable operator to reduce that difference. Say th
