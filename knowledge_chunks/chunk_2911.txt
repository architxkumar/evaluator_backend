smallperturbations; pathplanning aloneisusually insufficient. Potential field techniques navigate robots by potential functions, defined overthe dis-
tance to obstacles and the goal location. Potential field techniques may get stuck in

from an explicit model of the environment. Such controllers can often be written as

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES
The word robot waspopularized by Czech playwright Karel Capek in his 1921 play R.U.R.
(Rossum s Universal Robots). The robots, which were grown chemically rather than con-
structed mechanically, end up resenting their masters and decide to take over. It appears
