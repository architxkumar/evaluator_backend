agatewith,say,Gate(X ). The
1
behavior of each gate is determined by its type: one of the constants AND,OR, XOR, or
NOT. Because a gate has exactly one type, a function is appropriate: Type(X ) XOR.

function In(1,X ) to denote the first input terminal for gate X . A similar function Out is

Finally,weneedtoknowwhetherasignalisonoroff. Onepossibility istouseaunary
predicate, On(t), which is true when the signal at a terminal is on. This makes it a little
difficult, however, to pose questions such as What are all the possible values of the signals
attheoutputterminalsofcircuit C ? Wethereforeintroduce asobjectstwosignalvalues, 1
