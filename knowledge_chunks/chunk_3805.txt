omes. Controlling a robot arm. The outcome is uncertain for a variety of reasons. Someone might move something into the path of the arm. The gears of the arm might stick. A slight error could cause the arm to knock over a whole stack of things. Helping a lawyer decide how to defend his client against a murder charge. Here we probably cannot even list all the possible outcomes, much less assess their probabilities. 2.3.4 Is a Good Solution Absolute or Relative? Consider the problem of answering questions based on a database of simple facts, such as the following: 1. Marcus was a man. Marcus was a Pompeian. Marcus was bom in 40 A.D. All men are mortal. All Pompeians died when the volcano erupted in 79 A.D. No mortal lives longer than 150 years. It is now 1991 A.D. I DW AWN 40 Artificial Intelligence Suppose we ask the question Is Marcus alive? By representing each of these facts in a formal language, such as predicate logic, and then using formal inference methods we can fairly easily derive an answer to the question. In fact, either of two reasoning paths will lead to the answer, as shown in Fig. 2.13. Since all we are interested in is the answer to the question, it does not matter which path we follow. If we do follow one path successfully to the answer, there is no reason to go back and see if some other path might also lead to a solution. Justification 1. Marcus was a man. axiom | 4.

Our goal is to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once. Suppose t
