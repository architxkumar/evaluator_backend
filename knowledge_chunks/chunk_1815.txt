tailment can be checked by enumerating models. Efficient model-checking inference

Bibliographical and Historical Notes 275 Inference rules are patterns of sound inference that can be used to find proofs. The
resolution rule yields a complete inference algorithm for knowledge bases that are
expressed in conjunctive normal form. Forward chaining and backward chaining

of possible states consistent with the observation history. Each update step requires

fullyobservable orsensorless environments. Propositional logic does not scale to environments of unbounded size because it lacks
