10.4 OTHER CLASSICAL PLANNING APPROACHES
Currentlythemostpopularandeffectiveapproaches tofullyautomated planning are: Translatingtoa Booleansatisfiability (SAT)problem Forwardstate-space searchwithcarefully craftedheuristics (Section10.2) Searchusingaplanning graph(Section10.3)
These three approaches are not the only ones tried inthe 40-year history of automated plan-
ning. Figure10.11showssomeofthetopsystemsinthe International Planning Competitions,

processed by SATPLAN. Thetranslation isaseriesofstraightforward steps: Propositionalize the actions: replace each action schema with a set of ground actions
