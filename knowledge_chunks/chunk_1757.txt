in Section 7.3 and the specifics of propositional logic in Section 7.4. While less expressive
than first-order logic (Chapter 8), propositional logic illustrates all the basic concepts of
logic; it also comes with well-developed inference technologies, which we describe in sec-
tions7.5and7.6. Finally,Section7.7combinestheconceptofknowledge-based agentswith

There must be a way to add new sentences to the knowledge base and a way to query
what is known. The standard names for these operations are TELL and ASK, respectively.
