Create a causal model. Determine the possible symptoms, disorders, treatments, and
outcomes. Then draw arcs between them, indicating what disorders cause what symptoms,
andwhattreatmentsalleviatewhatdisorders. Someofthiswillbewellknowntothedomain
expert, and some will come from the literature. Often the model will match well with the
informalgraphical descriptions giveninmedicaltextbooks.
Simplify to a qualitative decision model. Since we are using the model to make
treatment decisions and not for other purposes (such as determining the joint probability of
certain symptom disorder combinations), we can often simplify by removing variables that
are not involved in treatment decisions. Sometimes variables will have to be split or joined
to match the expert s intuitions. For example, the original aortic coarctation model had a
Treatmentvariable withvalues surgery, angioplasty, andmedication, andaseparate variable
for Timing of the treatment. But the expert had a hard time thinking of these separately, so
