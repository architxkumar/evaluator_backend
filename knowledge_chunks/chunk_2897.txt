25.6.3 Reactivecontrol
Sofarwehave considered control decisions that require some modelof theenvironment for
constructing either areference path orapotential field. There are some difficulties with this
approach. First, models that are sufficiently accurate are often difficult to obtain, especially
in complex or remote environments, such as the surface of Mars, or for robots that have
few sensors. Second, even in cases where we can devise a model with sufficient accuracy,
computational difficulties and localization error might render these techniques impractical.

One such example is the six-legged (hexapod) robot, shown in Figure 25.24(a), de-
signed forwalking through rough terrain. Therobot s sensors areinadequate toobtain mod-
elsoftheterrainforpathplanning. Moreover,evenifweaddedsufficientlyaccuratesensors,
the twelve degrees of freedom (two for each leg) would render the resulting path planning
problem computationally intractable.
It is possible, nonetheless, to specify a controller directly without an explicit environ-
mental model. (We have already seen this with the PD controller, which was able to keep a
complexrobotarmontarget withoutanexplicitmodeloftherobotdynamics;itdid,however,
require a reference path generated from a kinematic model.) Forthe hexapod robo
