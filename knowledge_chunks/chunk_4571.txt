Reward and penalty have been quantized by the following rules: A Reward signal is generated when any one of the conditions listed below is true. (a) The robot has low energy level and recharges and (b) The robot has high energy level and also has garbage on board. Likewise, a Penalty signal is generated when (a) The robot has low energy level when it catches the garbage and (b) The robot collides with an obstacle (losing energy). Affinity or the stimulation level s; ; is calculated as _ oe + ow (24,2) 2% S, tg 492 Artificial Intelligence et c E a NREENGRE RN where Qo, Q,' stand for number of times Ay; was penalized or rewarded respectively and on is the number of times both A,; and A,; were both activated by their respective antigens. The selection of an antibody from those that recognize the antigen is performed based on their concentration levels. These levels are governed by the affinity values. The dynamic concentration of the antibodies is given by the equation N N acy = Y $j, ij) ks 55, KECK + hy sjej Ksc; (24.3) at iz k=l ; where s, ; and s; comprise t He affinities between A,, and A,, and between the A,; and the detected antigen respectively. The c, terms form the concentration of antibodies (/ = 1, 2, ... VN) where N is the total number of antibodies. Note that the first term constitutes the stimulation of the paratope of A,; by the idiotope of A,,; while the second signifies the suppression of A,; when its idiotope is recognized by the paratope of A,,.
