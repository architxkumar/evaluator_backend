HoldsAt(loc(nikhil53, cricketPractice11), From 25 and Inertia to) The above reasoning process shows that Nikhil is at cricket practice at time tg. But is that (fact) logically entailed from the given information? Remember that entailment means that the conclusion is true whenever the premises are true. It so happens that this is not so for the above statements. Because there might be other statements that are also true but which are not mentioned in the narrative. For example it is possible that an event occurred in which Lavanya deflates Nikhil s bicycle at time t,. Or the event that Nikhil went off to a movie at time fg, which is not mentioned in the narrative. The astute reader would have noticed that we have glossed over the law of inertia and used it somewhat casually in the above proof . In fact, if we want the value of a fluent to be carried forward from one time to another we need to use the Inertia Axiom (reproduced here again for convenience).
