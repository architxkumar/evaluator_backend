The prehistory of speech recognition began in the 1920s with Radio Rex, a voice-
activated toy dog. Rex jumped out of his doghouse in response to the word Rex! (or
actually almostanysufficientlyloudword). Somewhatmoreserious workbeganafter World
War II. At AT TBell Labs, a system was built for recognizing isolated digits (Davis et al.,
1952)bymeansofsimplepatternmatchingofacousticfeatures. Startingin1971,the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)of the United States Department of Defense
funded four competing five-year projects to develop high-performance speech recognition
systems. Thewinner,andtheonlysystemtomeetthegoalof90 accuracywitha1000-word
vocabulary, was the HARPY system at CMU (Lowerre and Reddy, 1980). The final version
of HARP Ywasderivedfromasystemcalled DRAGO Nbuiltby CM Ugraduatestudent James
Baker (1975); DRAGON was the first to use HM Ms for speech. Almost simultaneously, Je-
linek (1976) at IBM had developed another HMM-based system. Recent years have been
characterized by steady incremental progress, larger data sets and models, and more rigor-
ouscompetitions onmorerealistic speech tasks. In1997, Bill Gatespredicted, The PCfive
yearsfrom now youwon trecognize it,because speech willcomeintotheinterface. That
didn t quitehappen, butin2008 hepredicted Infiveyears, Microsoft expects more Internet
searches to be done through speech than through typing on a keyboard. History will tell if
heisrightthistimearound.
Several good textbooks on speech recognition are available (Rabiner and Juang, 1993;
