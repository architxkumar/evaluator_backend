mapping, which specifies the probability that each (x,y) location is occupied by an obsta-
cle (Moravec and Elfes, 1985). Kuipers and Levitt (1988) were among the first to propose
topological rather than metric mapping, motivated by models ofhuman spatial cognition. A
seminal paperby Luand Milios(1997) recognized thesparseness ofthesimultaneous local-
ization and mapping problem, which gave rise tothedevelopment ofnonlinear optimization
techniques by Konolige (2004) and Montemerlo and Thrun (2004), as well as hierarchical
methodsby Bosseetal.(2004). Shatkayand Kaelbling(1997)and Thrunetal.(1998)intro-

Early mobile robot localization techniques are surveyed by Borenstein et al. (1996).
Although Kalman filtering was well known as a localization method in control theory for
decades, the general probabilistic formulation of the localization problem did not appear
in the AI literature until much later, through the work of Tom Dean and colleagues (Dean
etal., 1990, 1990) andof Simmonsand Koenig (1995). Thelatterwork introduced theterm
