ues for the action variables are determined by, 1. The start state 2. The goal constraints 3. The relation between actions and their preconditions 4. The relation between actions and their effects The action act(u, ..., z) chosen as a value for the it action variable should be such that all its preconditions satisfy the state Sj), and all its effects satisfy the state S;. Let the action act(u, ..., Zz) have m preconditions. For every precondition pre, 1 j m, of act(u, ..., Z) of the form x argy, ..., arp) Vv the precondition must be satisfied by the preceding state S;.,. This results in binary constraints of the form, aj act(u, ..., Z), X arQ4, -.-, AYp, Si) v for 1 j m, for 1 sisk Let the action act(u, ..., z) have n effects. For every effect e;, 1sjsn, of act(u, ..., Z) of the form X argy, ..., ar9p) v, the constraint Xj(argy, ..., argp) v must be satisfied by the succeeding state S;. aj act(u, ..., Z), X argy, ..., Ap, Sj) v for 1 j n, for 1 i sk Consider the action UnSt(x, y) described above. It has three preconditions, On(x) y, Holding(arm) nil, Clear(x) 1, and two effects -Holding(arm) x and Clear(y) 1. We get the set of constraints that are all possible instances of the following. The constraints are defined for each action variable a; 1 i k. a, UnSt(x, y), On(x, S ,) y forl i k a, UnSt(x, y), Holding(arm, S, ,) nil forl i k a, UnSt(x, y), Clear(x, S;, ,) I forl i k a, UnSt(x, y), Holding(arm, S,) x forl isk a, UnSt(x, y), Clear(y, S,) I forl i k The instances of the above constraints will have the parameters x and y replaced by A, B and C wherever possible. However, these constraints are not enough. If we want every solution of the resulting CSP to be a valid plan, we must also assert that all the effects of actions have been taken into account. In other words, we should add constraints to circumscribe the effects of actions. We should say that if any state variable is not affected by the action a; then it remains unchanged in the succeeding layer. These con
