A third approach handles equality reasoning entirely within an extended unification
algorithm. That is, terms are unifiable if they are provably equal under some substitution,
where provably allows for equality reasoning. For example, the terms 1 2 and 2 1
normally are not unifiable, but a unification algorithm that knows that x y y x could

always yields a clause (in this case, Q R) that is shorter than the other clause. When
the unit preference strategy was first tried for propositional inference in 1964, it led to a
