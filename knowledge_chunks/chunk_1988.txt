direction (regression). Effective heuristics can be derived by subgoal independence

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES
AI planning arose from investigations into state-space search, theorem proving, and control
theoryandfromthepracticalneedsofrobotics,scheduling,andotherdomains. STRIPS(Fikes
and Nilsson, 1971), the first majorplanning system, illustrates the interaction of these influ-
ences. STRIPS wasdesignedastheplanning componentofthesoftwareforthe Shakeyrobot

Solver (Newell and Simon, 1961), a state-space search system that used means ends anal-
ysis. Bylander (1992) shows simple STRIPS planning to be PSPACE-complete. Fikes and
