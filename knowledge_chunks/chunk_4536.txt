tions. It can be seen that the fitness saturates after a certain number of generations and shows no change after that. This means that for a particular set-up (which in the current case is - a population size of 40, crossover probability of 0.6 and mutation probability of 0.09) the GA levels off at about the 1500th generation yielding a maximum fitness value of 0.00645. However this does not necessarily mean that we have hit the global optimus.

It may be observed that the maxima is hit at a crossover frequency of 0.6 in both the cases. This could provide us a hunch on the selection of the most suitable crossover probability. Observe that the high mutation rate of 0.6 and low crossover rate (0.1) can lead to a local optimum of 0.00623.

It is clear from the graph that lower mutation probabilities are preferred. In practice high mutation may cause the search to jump around too frequently from one portion of the search space to another. This may lead the search astray.
