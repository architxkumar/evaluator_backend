e difference is then scaled by the belief in 4 given only the second observation. A corresponding explanation can be given, then, for the formula for computing disbelief. From MB and MD, CF can be computed. Notice that if several sources of corroborating evidence are pooled, the absolute value of CF will increase. If conflicting evidence is introduced, the absolute value of CF will decrease. A simple example shows how these functions operate. Suppose we make an initial observation that confirms our belief in h with MB = 0.3. Then MD[h#,s,] = 0 and CFA, s,] = 0.3. Now we make a second observation, which also confirms h, with MB{h,s2| = 0.2. Now: MBIA,s, A 4] = 0.3 +0.2-0.7 = 0.44 - MDIh,s, A 5] = 0.0 CFIh,s, \ sz} = 0.44 You can see from this example how slight confirmatory evidence can accumulate to produce increasingly larger certainty factors. Next let s consider the scenario of Fig. 8.1(b), in which we need to compute the certainty factor of a combination of hypotheses. In particular, this is necessary when we need to know the certainty factor of a rule antecedent that contains several clauses (as, for example, in the staphylococcus rule given above). The combination certainty factor can be computed from its MB and MD. The formulas MYCIN uses for the MB of the conjunction and the disjunction of two hypotheses are: MB\h, r N Ay, e] = min(MBIh,, e],MBth, e}) MBIh, /\ hy e\ = max(MB[h,,e], MB|Aye]) MD can be computed analogously. Finally, we need to consider the scenario in Fig. 8.1(c), in which rules are chained together with the result that the uncertain outcome of one rule must provide the input to another. Our solution to this problem will also handle the case in which we must assign a measure of uncertainty to initial inputs. This could easily happen in situations where the evidence is the outcome of an experiment or a laboratory test whose results are not completely accurate. In such a case, the certainty factor of the hypothesis must take into account both th
