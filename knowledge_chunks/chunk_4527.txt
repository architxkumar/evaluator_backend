select a set of N chromosomes whose average distribution is equal to the expected count distribution. While there could be many ways of doing this, we go in for a simple solution. The significance of the expected count lies in the fact that if we generated 1000 sets of each of these chromosomes (4000 in ail), then about 286 would be of type {0, 0, 1}, 571 of type {0, 1, 0} and so on. If we now choose 4 chromosomes from this poo! of 4000, then it is unlikely that the ones that have low fitness are selected. Likewise in a population of 1000, we could imagine that if we chose a random number from 0-999 and obtained a number between 0-70, it means we are selecting the chromosome {0, 0, |} since its percentage probability is about 71. Similarly, if the number falls in the range of 71-213 (143 units apart) it would mean selection of (0, 1, 1] (percentage probability is 14.29) and for ranges 214-642 and 643-999 (429 and 357 units apart since percentage probabilities are 42.86 and 35.71 respectively) it would mean selection of {1, 10} and {1, 0, O} respectively. With this as our mode of selection, we generate four random numbers to select four chromosomes for the next generation, Let's say the randomly generated numbers are 265, 801, 515 and 85. Accordingly these chromosomes have been evaluated in Table 23.2 Table 23.2 A Mode of Selection Value Generated Selected solution 265 {1, 1, 0} 801 {1,0, 1} 515 {1, 1,0} 85 {0, 1,0} The new set of four chromosomes form what is called the mating pool. It is on these that we apply the genetic operators. It may be worth mentioning here that commonly the Roulette Wheel method is used for selection.
