Robertson and Sparck Jones (1976). Domingos and Pazzani (1997) provide an explanation

for the surprising success of naive Bayesian reasoning even in domains where the indepen-
denceassumptions areclearlyviolated.
There are many good introductory textbooks on probability theory, including those by
Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (2008) and Grinstead and Snell (1997). De Groot and Schervish
(2001) offer a combined introduction to probability and statistics from a Bayesian stand-
point. Richard Hamming s (1991) textbook gives a mathematically sophisticated introduc-
tiontoprobabilitytheoryfromthestandpointofapropensityinterpretation basedonphysical
symmetry. Hacking (1975) and Hald (1990) coverthe early history of theconcept of proba-
bility. Bernstein(1996)givesanentertaining popularaccount ofthestoryofrisk.

13.5 This question deals with the properties of possible worlds, defined on page 488 as
assignments to all random variables. We will work with propositions that correspond to
exactly one possible world because they pin
