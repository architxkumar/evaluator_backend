Game theory and MD Ps are combined in the theory of Markov games, also called
stochasticgames(Littman,1994;Huand Wellman,1998). Shapley(1953)actuallydescribed
the value iteration algorithm independently of Bellman, but his results were not widely ap-
preciated, perhaps because they were presented in the context of Markov games. Evolu-

tionary game theory (Smith, 1982; Weibull, 1995) looks at strategy drift over time: if your
opponent s strategy is changing, how should you react? Textbooks on game theory from
aneconomics point ofview include those by Myerson (1991), Fudenberg and Tirole(1991),
Osborne(2004),and Osborneand Rubinstein(1994);Mailathand Samuelson(2006)concen-
