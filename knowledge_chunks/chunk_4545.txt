In a population comprising I011, 1010, 11]1 and 0000, the value of m for the schemata 10** is 2. As we have observed in the job-shop problem, a solution string is selected based on its fitness function p,=f,/ Lf, and the expected number of such solutions in the new mating pool is Np,. Thus if the average fitness of a schemata Sis given by f(S) at some time then the number of such schemata at time ( + 1) will be given by m(S, t+ 1) = m(S, 2) - (NF(SY EA} . +(23.4) The term in the braces is equivalent to Np,. Since Lf,/N is the average fitness f,, of the population (not schemata), m S, t+ 1) = m(S, ).{f (Vy) (23.2) Since both f(S) and f,, change with time, we may yet approximate the ratio @ = f(S)/f,, to be a constant in which case m(S, 1) = m(S, 0). a (23.3) This exponential function thus decays when a < | and grows otherwise causing corresponding effects on the number of the schemata in question. 23.7.5 Effect of Changes on Schemata Due to Crossover This effect is dominated by the point of crossover or the crossing site. If this point is within the defining length of the solution string then the characteristics of the schemata may be lost and will depend on the mate. For example consider the crossover case shown below: fe Sy=**O** 1 X=1101001 Crossing site If the mate Y is 0010000, the offsprings 1101000 and 0010001 do not preserve the original schemata S,. However for a mate Y = 1001111, the offsprings 1101111 and 1001001 retain the original characteristics. Of course the schema characteristics induced by the mate is not dominant and thus we may use inequalities while expressing probabilities. If the length of the solution strings is high and the population contains diverse solutions it tends to reduce the effect of th
