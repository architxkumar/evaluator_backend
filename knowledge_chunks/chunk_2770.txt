Figure 23.12 The Vauquois triangle: schematic diagram of the choices for a machine
translationsystem (Vauquois,1968). We startwith English textatthe top. An interlingua-
based system follows the solid lines, parsing English first into a syntactic form, then into
a semanticrepresentationandaninterlinguarepresentation,andthenthroughgenerationto
a semantic, syntactic, andlexicalformin French. A transfer-basedsystem usesthe dashed

23.4.2 Statisticalmachine translation
Now that we have seen how complex the translation task can be, it should come as no sur-
prisethatthemostsuccessfulmachinetranslationsystemsarebuiltbytrainingaprobabilistic
model using statistics gathered from a large corpus of text. This approach does not need
a complex ontology of interlingua concepts, nor does it need handcrafted grammars of the
sourceandtargetlanguages, norahand-labeled treebank. Allitneedsisdata sampletrans-

Here the factor P(f)is the target language model for French; it says how probable a given

TRANSLATION sentence is in French. P(e f) is the translation model; it says how probable an English

sentence is as a translation for a given French sentence. Similarly, P(f e) is a translation
modelfrom Englishto French.
Shouldweworkdirectly on P(f e),orapply Bayes ruleandworkon P(e f)P(f)?
In diagnostic applications like medicine, it is easier to model the domain in the causal di-
rection: P(symptoms disease)ratherthan P(disease symptoms). Butintranslation both
directions are equally easy. The earliest work in statistical machine translation did apply
Bayes rule in part because the researchers had agood language model, P(f), andwanted
to make use of it, and in part because they
