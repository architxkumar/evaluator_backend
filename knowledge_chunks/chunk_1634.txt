BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES
Local search techniques have a long history in mathematics and computer science. Indeed,
the Newton Raphson method (Newton, 1671; Raphson, 1690) can be seen as a very effi-
cient local search method for continuous spaces in which gradient information is available.
Brent (1973) is a classic reference for optimization algorithms that do not require such in-
formation. Beam search, which we have presented as a local search algorithm, originated
as a bounded-width variant of dynamic programming for speech recognition in the HARPY
system(Lowerre,1976). Arelatedalgorithm isanalyzed indepthby Pearl(1984,Ch.5).
Thetopic oflocal search wasreinvigorated intheearly 1990s bysurprisingly good re-
sults for large constraint-satisfaction problems such as n-queens (Minton et al., 1992) and
logical reasoning (Selman et al., 1992) and by the incorporation of randomness, multiple
simultaneoussearches,andotherimprovements. Thisrenaissanceofwhat Christos Papadim-
itriou has called New Age algorithms also sparked increased interest among theoretical
computer scientists (Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou, 1992; Aldous and Vazirani, 1994). In
