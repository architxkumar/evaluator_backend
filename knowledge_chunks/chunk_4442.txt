ake an accurate prediction. Yet anyone in this situation can immediately visualize what is likely to happen and take rapid action to prevent it. 410 Artificial Intelligence NN 19.1.1 Representing Qualitative Information Qualitative physics seeks to understand physical processes by building models of them. A model is an abstract representation that eliminates irrelevant details. For example, if we want to predict the motion of a ball, we may want to consider its mass and velocity, but probably not its color. Traditional physical models are buil. up from real-valued variables, rates of change, expressions, equations, and states. Qualitative physics provides similar building blocks, ones which are more abstract and nonnureric. Variables tin traditional physics, real-valued variables are used to represent features of objects, such as position, velocity, angle, and temperature. Qualitative physics retains this notion, but restricts each variable to a smail finite set of possible values. For example, the amount of water in a pot might be represented as one of {empty, between, full}, and its temperature as {frozen, between, boiling}. Quantity Spaces A small set of discrete values for a variable is called a quantity space. The elements of a quantity space are usually ordered with respect to each other so'that one value can be said to be smaller than another. e Rates of Change Variables take on different values at different times. A real-valued rate of change (dx/dt) can be modeled qualitatively with the quantity space {decreasing, steady, increasing}. Expressions Variables can be combined to form expressions. Consider representing the volume of water in a glass as {empty, between, full}. If we pour the contents of one glass into another, how much water will the second glass contain? We can add two qualitative values with the following chart: empty + empty = empty empty + between = between empty + full = full between + between = { between, full} between + full = full + overf
