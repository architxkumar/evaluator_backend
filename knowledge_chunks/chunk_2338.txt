weatherconditions; and so on. Problems like these, inwhich outcomes are characterized by
MULTIATTRIBUTE twoormoreattributes, arehandledby multiattributeutilitytheory.
UTILITYTHEORY
We will call the attributes X X ,...,X ; a complete vector of assignments will be
1 n
x (cid:16)x ,...,x (cid:17),whereeachx iseitheranumericvalueoradiscretevaluewithanassumed
1 n i
ordering on values. We will assume that higher values of an attribute correspond to higher
utilities, all other things being equal. For example, if we choose Absence Of Noise as an
attributeintheairportproblem,thenthegreateritsvalue,thebetterthesolution.8 Webeginby
examining casesinwhichdecisions canbemadewithoutcombining theattribute valuesinto
a single utility value. Then we look at cases in which the utilities of attribute combinations
canbespecifiedveryconcisely.

One would not hesitate to reject S . We then say that there is strict dominance of S over

not be considered further. Strict dominance is often very useful in narrowing down the field
of choices to the real contenders, although it seldom yields a unique choice. Figure 16.4(a)

What about the general case, where the outcomes are uncertain? A direct analog of strict
dominancecanbeconstructed, where,despitetheuncertainty, allpossibleconcreteoutcomes
for S strictly dominate all possible outcomes for S . (See Figure 16.4(b).) Of course, this
