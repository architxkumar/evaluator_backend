context-free grammars (also known as phrase structure grammars)
are areinvention of atechnique firstused byancient Indian grammarians (especially Panini,
ca. 350 B.C.) studying Shastric Sanskrit (Ingerman, 1967). They were reinvented by Noam
Chomsky (1956) for the analysis of English syntax and independently by John Backus for
the analysis of Algol-58 syntax. Peter Naurextended Backus s notation and is now credited
(Backus, 1996) with the N in BNF, which originally stood for Backus Normal Form. ATTRIBUTE Knuth (1968) defined a kind of augmented grammar called attribute grammar that is use-

ful for programming languages. Definite clause grammars were introduced by Colmer-
auer(1975)anddeveloped andpopularized by Pereiraand Shieber(1987).
Probabilistic context-free grammars were investigated by Booth (1969) and Salo-
maa(1969). Otheralgorithms for PCF Gsare presented in theexcellent short monograph by

sky and Martin (2008). Baker (1979) introduces the inside outside algorithm for learning a
PCFG,and Lariand Young(1990)describeitsusesandlimitations. Stolckeand Omohundro

Lexicalized PCF Gs(Charniak, 1997; Hwa,1998) combine thebest aspects of PCF Gs
and n-gram models. Collins (1999) describes PCFG parsing that is lexicalized with head
features. Petrovand Klein(2007a) show howtogetthe advantages oflexicalization without

There have been many attempts to write formal grammars of natural languages, both
in pure linguistics and in computational linguistics. There are several comprehensive but
