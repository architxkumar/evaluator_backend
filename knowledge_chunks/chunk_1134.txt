That is, the following sets of assumptions are nogoods. -0k,(C), ok,(4), ok,(B) cok C), 70k, (A), okg(B) ok (C), ok (A), ok(B) cok (C), -ok,(A), ok,(B) ok(C), ok,(4), ok,(B) (-ok(C), -0ky(A). ok g(B) -0k(C), 0fy(4). of(B) -ok(C), ok,(A), -ok,(B) -ok(C), okp(A), ok,(B) -ok( C), okp(A), okg(B) -ok(C), okp(A), ok(B) -ok(C), ofA), ok (BY 0k (C), of(4), ok(B) 0k (C), ofA), ok g(B) -ok;(C), of(4), of(B) Vj AISJSQ D nogood -ok C), asmA, ok B) ) This means that, Vj (sgjsQ 3 (COK C) A asmA 5 OK B) ) is added as a justification. And since, OK,(B) OK,(B) 4 ... OKg(B) OK(B) it follows that OK(B) must be N. Now since all environments of the form n0ki(C), asmA, ok(B) are also nogoods, it follows that all environments of the form 70k; (C), asmA are nogoods. By a similar argument for 1 j P, we can infer justifications of the form (7OK; (C) D OK (A)), which leads us to the justification, OK,(A) A OKo(A) A... OKp(A) OK(A) If OK(A) is IN then the nogood 70k C), ok(A) reduces to 70k(C) which results in the conclusion that OK; (C) must be JN. Given the fact that all fault modes of component C are inconsistent with the observations, we infer a similar statement for all the fault modes. That is, Wi (1sisM D OK C)) which in turn leads to the conclusion OK(C). This means that any candidate diagnosis of the form ..., 7ok(C), ... must be discarded. As shown in the example in Section 17.3.4, this can lead to a considerable amount of pruning in the space of candidate diagnosis. In that specific example, once we infer that the bulb B3 is okay, we discard all candidates that include B3. Reasoning in a similar fashion with their fault models, one can exonerate the battery S and the wires W; to Wg. This leaves the only minimal candidate which says that the bulbs B, and Bz must be broken. 17.5 Probabilistic Reasoning So far our view of knowledge and belief has been through a Boolean lens.
