titition gorithm proceeds as before for tne first wo recursive Call. ine tmMira Call NOW IS aliferent -Varor ?z), ((?z 0)). This time the algorithm returns the unifier theta ((?x (successor ?z) (?z 0)). App on correctly unifies the two formula into (SmallerOrEqualThan 0 (success9r.0)). com Handling Existential Quantifiers said that the implicit quantifier form of a formula implicitly defines variables to be universally quantifi st order formula has existentially quantified variables? The skolemization process replaces exi J variables either by special constants known as Skolem constants or by special functions known a: the existential quantifier is not in the scope of any universal quantifier, then the variable it que by a Skolem constant. For example, the statements, 3 z (Student(z) A Bright(z)) dy girly) A Vx (boy(x) likes(x, y)) colemized as, ((Student sk1) A (Bright sk1)) ((girl sk2) A ((boy ?x) (likes x, sk2))) ;kolem constant is not a real constant in the sense that we do not know what it maps to in the domai t it maps to some element. It may also map to more than one element, as for example in the first s sre may be more than one bright student 2. the existential quantifier is in the scope of one or more universal quantifiers then the existentially c s a Skolem function of the corresponding universally quantified variables. For example the statemen Vx Vy 4z(LessThan(x, z) LessThan(y, z)) Vx (boy(x) D Sy (girl(y) A likes(x, y)) 3 colemized as, ((LessThan ?x (sk57 ?x ?y)) A (LessThan ?y (sk57 ?x ?y)) ((boy ?x) ((girl (sk16 ?x)) A (likes ?x (sk16 ?x)))) 57 and sk16 are Skolem functions. A Skolem function is not a mapping from the arguments to the ion. Rather it says that the value is dependent upon the arguments in some way. The expression (sk: some number that is greater than x and y. Likewise (sk16 ?x) is some girl who x likes. While cor 5 we may use names of Skolem functions meaningful to us, like (greaterThanBoth ?x ?y) or (LikedBy ner a variable is universa
