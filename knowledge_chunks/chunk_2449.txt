faces of family members, but even the best programmers are unable to program a computer
to accomplish that task, except by using learning algorithms. This chapter first gives an
overview of the various forms of learning, then describes one popular approach, decision-
tree learning, in Section 18.3, followed byatheoretical analysis oflearning in Sections 18.4
and 18.5. We look at various learning systems used in practice: linear models, nonlinear
models(inparticular, neuralnetworks),nonparametricmodels,andsupportvectormachines.

Componentstobelearned
Chapter2described severalagentdesigns. Thecomponents oftheseagentsinclude:
1. Adirectmappingfromconditions onthecurrentstatetoactions.
2. Ameanstoinferrelevantproperties oftheworldfromthepercept sequence.
3. Information about the way the world evolves and about the results of possible actions
theagentcantake.
4. Utilityinformation indicating thedesirability ofworldstates.
5. Action-value information indicating thedesirability ofactions.
6. Goalsthatdescribe classesofstateswhoseachievement maximizestheagent s utility.
Eachofthesecomponentscanbelearned. Consider,forexample,anagenttrainingtobecome
a taxi driver. Every time the instructor shouts Brake! the agent might learn a condition action rule for when to brake (component 1); the agent also learns every time the instructor
does not shout. By seeing many camera images that it is told contain buses, it can learn
to recognize them (2). By trying actions and observing the results for example, braking
hard on a wet road it can learn the ef
