invariant: Imagine a set of points in a plane, measured by their x and y coordinates. Now
imagine rotating the axes by 45o. You d get a different set of (x (cid:2) ,y (cid:2) ) values representing
the same points. If you apply L regularization before and after rotating, you get exactly

coordinates). Thatisappropriate whenthechoiceofaxesreallyisarbitrary when itdoesn t

Linear functions can be used to do classification as well as regression. For example, Fig-
ure18.15(a)showsdatapointsoftwoclasses: earthquakes(whichareofinteresttoseismolo-
gists)andunderground explosions (whichareofinterestto armscontrolexperts). Eachpoint
is defined by two input values, x and x , that refer to body and surface wave magnitudes

computed from the seismic signal. Given these training data, the task of classification is to
