although similar ideas were developed independently by Braitenberg (1984), whose book,
Vehicles, describes a series of simple robots based on the behavioral approach. The suc-
cess of Brooks s six-legged walking robot was followed by many other projects. Connell,
in his Ph.D. thesis (1989), developed a mobile robot capable of retrieving objects that was
entirely reactive. Extensions of the behavior-based paradigm to multirobot systems can be
found in (Mataric, 1997) and (Parker, 1996). GRL (Horswill, 2000) and COLBERT (Kono-

man world champion team in soccer by 2050. Play occurs in leagues for simulated robots,
wheeled robots of different sizes, and humanoid robots. In 2009 teams from 43 countries
