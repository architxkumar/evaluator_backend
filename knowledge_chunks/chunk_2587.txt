19.5 INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING
Inductivelogicprogramming(ILP)combinesinductivemethodswiththepoweroffirst-order
representations, concentrating in particular on the representation of hypotheses as logic pro-
grams.3 It has gained popularity for three reasons. First, ILP offers a rigorous approach to
the general knowledge-based inductive learning problem. Second, it offers complete algo-
rithms for inducing general, first-order theories from examples, which can therefore learn
successfully in domains where attribute-based algorithms are hard to apply. An example is
in learning how protein structures fold (Figure 19.10). The three-dimensional configuration
of a protein molecule cannot be represented reasonably by a set of attributes, because the
configuration inherently refers to relationships between objects, not to attributes of a single
object. First-order logic is an appropriate language for describing the relationships. Third,
inductive logic programming produces hypotheses that are (relatively) easy for humans to
read. For example, the English translation in Figure 19.10 can be scrutinized and criticized
byworkingbiologists. Thismeansthatinductive logicprogrammingsystemscanparticipate
