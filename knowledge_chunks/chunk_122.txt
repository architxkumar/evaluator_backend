elow shows the progress of Beam Search of width 2. For each node in the search space, the candidate string and the heuristic (objective) value are depicted. At each level, the best two nodes are chosen for expansion. Since in our problem the value of the objective function increases by a unit amount, and since the maximum value is 6, the search can move forward only three steps. This is because the Beam Search, being an extension of Hill Climbing, is constrained to only move forward to better nodes. 3) 11111 oT 4fonn 3) 10111 3) 11011 4 inoi 3 11110 Pi . 3) EMI 4) 00111) 4 01011 5 o1101 3 oui s fon0i 4 10101 4) 11001 3) 11111 4) 11100 Z7 ate : 4) 11101 5 00101 5 O1001 4) OLLI 4 01100) 4 11101 5) 00101 5 01001 4) 01111 4)01100 FIGURE 3.18 Beam Search with width 2 fails to solve the SAT problem. Starting with a value 3, the solution should be reached in 3 steps. In fact the node marked leads to a solution in three steps. If instead of 11111 we had chosen 01110, the node marked with a star in Figure 3.18, then even the Beam Search would have found a path of monotonic increasing values to reach a goal state (there are three different satisfying valuations for the above instance). This means that with a suitable starting point, a solution can be reached. Even with the Hill Climbing algorithm, one can reach the solution. An extreme case of this is if one chose a goal as the starting point itself. We explore variations of search algorithms that deploy random choices in the next chapter, and one of them is to randomly choose different starting nodes. Another way to reach a goal node is to not terminate the search at an optimum point, but to continue looking further. This could be done while keeping track of the best solution found. But if one is to search further beyond an optimum, what should be the terminating criteria? One would then have to devise algorithms that have a criterion decided in advance. Moreover, if one is to get off an (local) optimum, what should be the c
