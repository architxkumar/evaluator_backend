The preceding discussion assumes that the effects of an HLA the reachable set for
anygiveninitial state can bedescribed exactlybydescribing theeffect oneachvariable. It
would be nice if this were always true, but in many cases we can only approximate the ef-

wiggly reachable sets rather like the wiggly-belief-state problem illustrated in Figure 7.21
on page 271. For example, we said that Go(Home,SFO) possibly deletes Cash; it also
possibly adds At(Car,SFO Long Term Parking); but it cannot do both in fact, it must do
exactly one. As with belief states, we may need to write approximate descriptions. Wewill

and possibly adds At(Car,SFO Long Term Parking). Another good example arises in the
8-puzzle, half of whose states are unreachable from any given state (see Exercise 3.4 on
page 113): the optimistic description of Act might well include the whole state space, since
theexactreachable setisquitewiggly.
With approximate descriptions, the test for whether a plan achieves the goal needs to
be modified slightly. If the optimistic reachable set for the plan doesn t intersect the goal,
