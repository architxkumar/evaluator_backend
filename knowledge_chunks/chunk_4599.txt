 written the clauses for read_4rm_file and write_2_file into a file named my_file_io.pl, then the program may be consulted (or loaded into the system) by { ?- consult( my_file_io.p I ). Now all clauses within can be used. You may also wish to reload a modified version of the same file. For this you can use reconsult( my_file_io.pl ). Naturally the older version is overwritten. Multiple knowledge bases may also be loaded or reconsulted. For instance consult [ my_first_program , my_data.dat*]). If the file extension is missing it is assumed to be a .p/ (PROLOG program) file. 25.15 SOME ASPECTS SPECIFIC TO LPA PROLOG Logic Programming Associates (LPA) PROLOG offers quite a few toolboxes that allow writing enhanced PROLOG programs. This book illustrates a couple of them in brief. The readers are advised to go through the documentation available online at http:/Avww.lpa.co.uk/. The site currently hosts free trial versions of its goodies. 25.15.1 Chimera Agent Engine The new buzz word in Al is the agent of course the Intelligent Agent. We discussed the concept of an agent in brief in section 16.3 but this entity may still seem alien. In the following sections we will describe an agent PROLOG - The Natural Language of Artificial Intelligence 517 again and then go ahead to writing a sample program to realize agents using LPA s Chimera Agent Engine. Though the word Chimera possibly stands for a grotesque mythical female being with a lion s head, a goat s body and a tail that resembles that of a serpent, all contrary characteristics, Chimera in the current context happens to be an agent that is part server and part client and features properties of a component in a distributed computing environment. Well, you can always impart more features to it! As mentioned earlier, before we take a look at it, we need to comprehend the concept of an agent. Of Agents - Their Definition and Characteristics In Section 16.3 we had opened up the term agent whose definition was described as vag
