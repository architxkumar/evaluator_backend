isn t another short-cut across the gap.) The check can be done when each node is generated
or selected for expansion and, with a hash table, will take constant time. For example, if a
problem has solution depth d 6, and each direction runs breadth-first search one node at a
time,thenintheworstcasethetwosearches meetwhentheyhavegenerated allofthenodes

for a standard breadth-first search. Thus, the time complexity of bidirectional search using
breadth-first searches in both directions is O(bd 2). The space complexity is also O(bd 2).
