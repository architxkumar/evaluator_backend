toanotherobject. Mathematics provides anice example: suppose wediscoverthatthere isa

Wecan give this number a name, such as e, but it would be a mistake to give itthe name of
an existing object, such as . In logic, the new name is called a Skolem constant. Existen-

Whereas Universal Instantiation can be applied many times to produce many different
consequences, Existential Instantiation can be applied once, and then the existentially quan-
tified sentence can be discarded. Forexample, weno longer need x Kill(x,Victim)once

The substitution replaces a variable with a term (a piece of syntax) to produce a new sentence, whereas an

9.1.2 Reduction to propositional inference
Once we have rules for inferring nonquantified sentences from quantified sentences, it be-
comes possible to reduce first-order inference to propositional inference. In this section we
givethemainideas;thedetailsaregivenin Section9.5.
The first idea is that, just as an existentially quantified sentence can be replaced by
one instantiation, a universally quantified sentence can be replaced by the set of all possible
instantiations. Forexample, supposeourknowledgebasecontainsjustthesentences x King(x) Gr
