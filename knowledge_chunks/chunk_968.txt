 shrunk and the BWB test would have failed. The algorithm would have gone up and applied the BOB to the next bucket C. As one can see from Figure 15.19, this test would have failed. It would have gone further up and come down to bucket D after answering the test Xp 142. It would have applied the BOB test to bucket D with success, and proceeded to inspect the cases in that bucket. The point to note is that because of the BOB test, it would have skipped bucket C, and saved computation time. x 80 - 175 - Ee 63 )- 60 55 50 145140 35; 30K 28 20 1S 10 Lf ft of of fj ff of fj jf if 2 20 30 40 40 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 FIGURE 15.19 The query Q falls in the bucket B. The 4 nearest neighbours are shown as white dots. The distance to the fourth case marks the radius of the ball. As one can see, the BWB test fails. The algorithm goes up the tree and considers the other child A. The BOB test succeeds for A, and the algorithm explores bucket A. 657160 15575045 4035 301257Pr 1s wh Ll i Ay a 0 4 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 FIGURE 15.20 After the algorithm explores bucket A, it finds two more cases. The ball shrinks in size and the BWB test will succeed for the region defined by buckets A and B. The algorithm thus terminates with the cases in white. How does one implement the BOB test and the BWB test? The BOB test needs to test whether the closest point in the region being considered is within the ball. Let us look at the two-dimensional space in Figure 15.21. There are essentially two kinds of points one needs to test the distance to. One when the closest point in the region, labelled 1 and 3 in the figure, is at the corner. The other is when the closest point is along one attribute dimension, as for region 2. TN Be? FIGURE 15.21 In a two-dimensional space, there are essentially two types of adjacent regions. The first is (regions 1 and 3), where the nearest point to the query is at a corner. The second of the type labelled 2 is where the nearest po
