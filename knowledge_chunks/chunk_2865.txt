Legs, unlike wheels, can handle rough terrain. However, legs are notoriously slow on

upright without moving its legs is called statically stable. A robot is statically stable if its

shown in Figure 25.6(a) may appear statically stable. However, it walks by lifting multiple
legs atthesame time, which renders itdynamically stable. Therobot can walkon snow and
ice, and it will not fall over even if you kick it (as demonstrated in videos available online).

Other methods of movement are possible: air vehicles use propellers or turbines; un-
derwater vehicles use propellers or thrusters, similar to those used on submarines. Robotic
