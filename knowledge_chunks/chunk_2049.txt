show that this can lead to incompleteness on certain problems. There is a long history of
scheduling inaerospace. T-SCHED (Drabble, 1990)wasusedtoschedule mission-command
sequencesforthe UOSAT-II satellite. OPTIMUM-AIV (Aarupetal.,1994)and PLAN-ERS1
(Fuchs et al., 1990), both based on O-PLAN, were used for spacecraft assembly and obser-
vation planning, respectively, at the European Space Agency. SPIKE (Johnston and Adorf,
1992) was used for observation planning at NASA for the Hubble Space Telescope, while
the Space Shuttle Ground Processing Scheduling System (Deale et al., 1994) does job-shop
scheduling of up to 16,000 worker-shifts. Remote Agent (Muscettola et al., 1998) became

Thefacility inthe STRIPS program forlearning macrops macro-operators consist-

cal planning (Fikes et al., 1972). Hierarchy was also used in the LAWALY system (Siklossy
and Dreussi, 1973). The ABSTRIPS system (Sacerdoti, 1974) introduced the idea of an ab-
ABSTRACTION straction hierarchy, whereby planning at higher levels was permitted to ignore lower-level
