tions that were possible, assuming perfect sensing. Those same locations are still the most

In addition to filtering to estimate its current location, the robot can use smoothing
(Equation (15.13)) to work out where it was at any given past time for example, where it
began attime 0 and it can use the Viterbi algorithm towork out the mostlikely path it has
