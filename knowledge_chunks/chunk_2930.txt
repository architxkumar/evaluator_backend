Section26.1. Weak AI:Can Machines Act Intelligently? 1023
Philosophers suchas J.R.Lucas(1961) haveclaimedthatthistheorem showsthatmachines
arementallyinferiortohumans,becausemachinesareformalsystemsthatarelimitedbythe
incompletenesstheorem theycannotestablishthetruthoftheirown Go delsentence while
humans have no such limitation. This claim has caused decades of controversy, spawning a
vast literature, including two books by the mathematician Sir Roger Penrose (1989, 1994)

First,Go del sincompletenesstheoremappliesonlytoformalsystemsthatarepowerful
enough to do arithmetic. This includes Turing machines, and Lucas s claim is in part based
ontheassertionthatcomputersare Turingmachines. Thisisagoodapproximation, butisnot
quitetrue. Turingmachines areinfinite, whereascomputers arefinite,andanycomputercan

Go del s incompleteness theorem. Second, anagent should notbetooashamed thatitcannot

If Lucas asserted this sentence, then he would be contradicting himself, so therefore Lucas

thatdoesnotmakeusthinklessof Lucas. Totakeanotherexample,nohumancouldcompute
the sum of a billion 10 digit numbers in his or her lifetime, but a computer could do it in
seconds. Still, wedonotseeth
