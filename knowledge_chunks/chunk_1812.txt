SATPLAN has more surprises in store, however. The first is that it finds models with

For example, it may come up with a model in which both Forward0 and Shoot0 are true,

Itmight bepointed out that walking forward and shooting at the same timeis not so hard to
do, whereas, say, shooting and grabbing atthesametimeis ratherimpractical. Byimposing
action exclusion axioms only on pairs of actions that really do interfere with each other, we
