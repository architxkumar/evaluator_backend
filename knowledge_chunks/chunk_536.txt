 the plan to support them, or insert a new action into the plan. The second, threats, which could possibly disrupt a support for a goal, had to be dealt with by separating the threatening action, or moving it before or after the threatened link. The conditions required by a partial plan to be a valid one can be encoded in a SAT problem as well (Kautz et al., 1996). Kautz, McAllester and Selman report the encoding of a causal link planner SNLP (McAllester and Rosenblitt, 1991). Let us say that we want to solve the Sussman s anomaly in the blocks world, Start state Sp On(C, A), OnT(A), OnT(B), Clear(B), Clear(C), ArmE Goal G On(A, B), On(B, C) The set of possible ground actions is, A UnSt(A, B), UnSt(A, C), UnSt(C, B), UnSt(C, B), UnStB, A), UnSt(B, C), Stack(A, B), Stack(A, C), Stack(C, B), Stack(C, B), Stack(B, A), Stack(B, C), PkUp(A), PkUp(B), PkUp(C), PtDn(A), PtDn(B), PtDn(C), No-op The set of ground fluents is, F Clear(A), Clear(B), Clear(C), On(A, B), On(B, A), On(A, C), On(C, A), On(B, C), On(C, B), ArmE, OnT(A), OnT(B), OnT(C), Hold(A), Hold(B), Hold(C) We also have the two special actions Ap, which produces the start state, and A. which consumes the goal predicates. In plan space planning, we begin with the initial partial plan containing just these two actions, (Ap, A.) (see Chapter 7). The preconditions of A.. are the initial flaws, or open goals. Let us say that we are looking for a set of actions S s1, So, ..., S; , called step names, with no a priori temporal ordering constraints on these actions, except that the occur after Ag and before A... We know that for the Sussman s anomaly problem k 6. In practice, one could follow an iterative deepening approach to find a plan with the smallest number of actions. A ground causal link is of the form CausalLink(s;f, sj) where feprecond(s;) is a precondition of sj and is produced by s;, fe add(sj). A valid plan is an assignment of ground actions Aj A to the step names sje S such that, 1. Every goal in the partia
