f a system. The two plots for false negatives and false positives cross over at some point, suggesting that point as one where the two kinds of errors are equal. Based on the discussion above, however, an application developer may choose a point on either side of the crossover. Figure 15.35 is a sample plot from experiments on a case based reasoning approach to satellite health monitoring (Penta, 2005). As one can see from the figure, a similarity threshold of 0.995 on the similarity measure is needed in that system to ensure that there are no false negatives (dismissals), though the number of false positives (alarms) increase at that threshold.

The example of salary prediction we saw earlier is also an analytic problem. Instead of using K neighbours and taking the average salary, one could just take the best matching case and adapt it using rules. One can have a rule like for every year of increased (decreased) experience, add (subtract) 200 units to (from) the retrieved salary . Likewise, one can add similar linear interpolation rules for the other attributes. Users of log tables from the twentieth century would have recognized this method! Derivational adaptation could be used in analytic problems like price estimation. Let us say one is implementing a CBR system in which the price or rental of a house is computed as a function of various features. Then from a case base of houses, one could pick a case with emphasis on location and adapt its price based on the other features, like the number of bedrooms. 15.3.2 Synthetic Reasoning In a synthetic task, CBR is used to construct a compound artifact like a design, a pla
